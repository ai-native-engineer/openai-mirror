<summary>자막: Build Hour: API & Codex (1:00:58)</summary>

[00:00]
Hey everyone, welcome back to OpenAI
Build Hours. I'm Christine. I'm on the
startup marketing team and today I'm
joined with Charlie and Ryan.
>> Hey folks, how's it going?
>> Hey everybody.
>> Awesome. Um, so Charlie is on our Dev X
team and he will be leading the session
and Ryan actually came all the way from
Seattle to be with us live in the studio
today. Um, and he's going to be chatting
about the future of work. Um so today's
session is all about um API and codecs.
And if this is your first build hour,
the goal of the session is to empower
you with the best practices, tools, AI
expertise to scale your company using
OpenAI APIs and models. Um and this
session in particular is really going to
teach you how to use codeex uh for all
of your engineering work and really what
is the next step in using codecs that
goes beyond um pair programming. So
here's a snapshot of what you can expect
today. We're going to spend five minutes
on all the new features that we launched
across Codeex and the API. We have lots

[00:01]
to share on the app as well as a new
model that just came out last week. So,
perfect timing. Then we're going to dive
into a demo on agent legibility score.
So, more to come and this is going to be
super practical for you to apply right
away um to your team. And then, uh Ryan
is going to talk about harness
engineering. So, we released a blog on
harness engineering from Ryan, who's
going to be actually in person talking
to you um about what this means and how
you can apply this to your team. And
then we'll save some time for a customer
spotlight basis. Um we'll be joining us
live and um we're really excited to have
the co-founder Mitch to actually talk
about how he uses Codex with his
engineering team. And then last but not
least, we'll save 15 minutes for Q&A. So
on the right side of your screen there's
a Q&A um chat box and you can submit
your questions. We'll answer them during
the session and then save a few to
answer live at the end. So with that
I'll turn it over to you both.
>> Thanks Christine. So let's kick off by
talking about what's new in codeex. Um

[00:02]
you know we've really entered this third
phase of uh using AI for software
development. The first phase was you
know autocomplete right sort of the
ghost text. The second phase was pair
programming where you would have a model
sit alongside you in your IDE and work
on you know generating code potentially
merging it into your existing code. Uh
but we've really come into this new era
of agent delegation and that's where you
can use things like the codeex desktop
app to manage multiple agents across
increasingly bigger and bigger tasks and
workflows.
>> I'm sure you all have felt this but
there was a huge step change in
capability with GPT 5.2. 2 and with GPT
5.3 and GPT 5.4 for on top of that we
have only trended increasingly into this
long horizon full delegation to the
agent direction and for me as a builder
this has been a fantastic thing to
empower me to do more and to do more
quicker
>> absolutely I think it's been kind of
surprising for me in terms of how
quickly my own workflow has changed

[00:03]
especially with the codeex desktop app
and you know it's mostly replaced the
IDE for me at this point
um and so yeah we've had you know just
in the last couple months like you were
mentioning 53 codeex which got even
faster, the Codex app which is now about
managing agents rather than necessarily
living in your terminal or your IDE. And
we just released GPT 5.4 uh which we'll
get into in a little bit.
Uh we'll be using the Codex app a lot
today. Um and if you were not aware,
it's now available on Windows uh which
is a big milestone for us.
>> Super excited about this app. And one
thing that is truly amazing about it is
has Windows native sandboxing through
and through. doesn't rely on WSL and
allows you to build with Codeex in ways
that are native to your local
development best practices. I think it's
super cool that we're bringing all the
power of Codex's security model and
best-in-class coding capability to
developers on Windows. Uh we really aim
to meet youall where you are uh to help

[00:04]
you build.
>> Yeah. Uh so much of the world, you know,
is building on Windows uh and so we'd
really love it for you to check out the
the latest Codex app.
The app itself uh has a few new features
in the recent weeks and months. Um you
know a big ones are skills and apps. So
you can bring capabilities and expertise
via skills. There are a number of them
that are recommended and come uh
pre-available inside the app. Uh and
then we also have apps which you can um
share across both chatbt and codecs and
you can use those they were previously
known as connectors but you can use
those to uh connect chatbt and codex to
the tools that you use every day. Yeah,
skills are super powerful. The way I
think about them is context that we give
to the agent to show them to what end do
you use the tools you have and how do
you use your tools well. And the fact
that we're bundling that bunch of them
with the codeex app means you get all
the best parts of how we use our tools
well to supercharge your own workflows.

[00:05]
Uh and let's talk about what's new in
the API. So the the big news from last
week is GPT 5.4. Um, it's got native
state-of-the-art computer use
capabilities. You'll see us refer to
this as KUA, computer use agent. U, it
supports up to a million tokens of
context. Um, and it has a new tool
search tool. Um, we found that in
practice, a lot of, you know, the the
cutting edge, the bleeding edge builders
were using hundreds and hundreds of
tools, which was potentially uh creating
issues with context management. So, we
now have tool search, which can help you
namespace those tools. Um and the agent
can intelligently sort of you know
progressively expose those to to get the
tools that it needs.
>> Yeah. The the term of art here if you
all have heard it is progressive
disclosure. The idea that not all the
tools need to be in context all the time
for every task the agent does. So
instead of giving them everything up
front, we hide uh all the tool
descriptions and uh individual calls
behind something that allows the agent

[00:06]
to do a little bit more natural
discovery and choose which parts it
pulls into context intelligently.
>> Exactly. Um and it's the most token
efficient reasoning model. You know, you
can see on our benchmarks, it's a
achieving the same performance as 53
codeex and 52, but with a fraction of
the token consumption and latency.
Uh we're not going to touch on all these
today. I would encourage everybody to
check out developers.openai.com
to look through the API change log. Um,
but some of the big things we've shipped
just in the last month alone, uh, the
KUA API, which I mentioned, um, that
really beefs up the ability for
developers to to manage um, browsers and
computers. Uh, we have a new mode, a
code mode where you can actually run um,
the model can generate JavaScript for
you to run in a ripple. Um, and so that
dramatically speeds up the time it takes
to do. Previously you would have to sort
of click and screenshot and find
coordinates and now you can compress
that all into like a single JavaScript
execution statement.

[00:07]
>> Love to give the model more tools and
let it cook.
>> Yeah. Um we have uh skills and hosted
shell which we will be using in this
demo. Um skills you can upload to create
a skill ID which the model can
reference. Hosted shell gives the model
um a container environment which it can
spin up and then it can actually execute
bash commands inside of that container
environment. Um, and then we also have
websocket mode, uh, where, you know, if
you're building an integration on top of
the API, you can switch over to using
websockets. Um, and for extremely
toolheavy use cases, we find that it
improves latency by 20 to 30%. One of
the things in here that I'm most excited
about is the hosted shell tool because
it takes all the magic of coding agents
of giving them a computer and a shell in
order to go cook and solve really
complicated problems and puts it in our
API in a way that is super customizable,
able to be embedded deeply into the
agents that you build and optimize to
the way you eval the workflows that
you're building toward. And if you want
to use the codec harness itself, we do

[00:08]
make that easy too by shipping adapters
with the agents SDK to allow you to give
codecs to your agents as well. So we
kind of give you the best of both worlds
here with both of these options.
>> 100%. Yeah, our vision is to meet
developers where they are and give them
primitives whether it's hosted on our
infrastructure or running locally on
yours.
>> Uh cool. So with that in mind, let's
let's jump into our demo. Sweet. Um, one
of the principles that we're going to
talk about, you know, in the harness
engineering portion of of today's build
hour, um, is trying to make repositories
more legible for agents, right? And so,
um, we had this idea of using codeex to
actually make an app that will score a
GitHub repository um, along a certain
set of metrics that we've predefined,
right? So,
>> this is exciting because it's an easy
checklist that we're going to put
together that will guide you in the
direction of trying to remove humans
from the loop from different parts of
the code authoring process.
>> Yeah. So, I'm here in the Codex app. Um,
I've got a new folder here. U in the

[00:09]
interest of time, I've actually created
a plan in advance for the agent to go
ahead and implement. Um, this is the
kind of thing that you could easily
create yourself with plan mode in the
Codex app. Uh, but we've got, you know,
about 10 minutes here. So now I'm going
to go ahead and tell it implement
plan.md right and so behind the scenes
the model is going to you know think for
a minute um decide to explore the
workspace and figure out you know what
files are available um what the current
state of the GitHub repository is um and
it's going to take a look at what it can
do.
>> Yeah, this is super exciting here
because the app makes this much more
digestible for me. uh it kind of lifts
me out of my terminal and puts me into a
higher level operating mode where I'm
more reviewing the agent rather than
being deep in the weeds with it. And
this is sort of the transformation in
how we interact with this tool that has
been enabled by this huge step change in
capability that really only became
possible this year.
>> There's something interesting here. It

[00:10]
the app is actually the model is
actually realized. We've built a
previous version of this app in an
archived folder uh and it's sort of
going into uh to take a look at that
code to I think learn from from previous
runs. This is uh kind of a peak at an
interesting technique that I have used
to build some agents for myself which is
to basically provide pointers to
previous trajectories, previous
iterations of the task. And this kind of
serves to give the model a reference for
how the task was completed previously,
what it might learn from those previous
trajectories, uh, and kind of gives you
a very cheap way to implement what we
call episodic memory. A way for the
agent to improve the way it works over
time while completing similar tasks.
>> While it's working, let's take a look
at, you know, some of the uh some of the
things going on in the Codeex app here.
Um, at the bottom, we've got a task
list. This is not anything that we
generated or specified. This is just the
model uh internally sort of saying here
is the road map that I need to complete

[00:11]
and giving us some visual indicators on
on what it's doing. Um
>> yeah, this is distinct from plan mode is
really just a nice way for me to have a
highlevel site of what the agent thinks
is up next for it. And I use this as a
tool for myself to figure out whether or
not I should interrupt or provide
steering to codeex as opposed to just
kind of letting it cook. Helps me have
confidence that the agent is doing the
things that I expect.
>> Yeah. And so if we we open up a new
thread, yeah, we can see, you know, if
you want to toggle on plan mode, um it's
really powerful for getting context,
asking you what direction you want to
take things in and developing a really,
really thorough plan. Uh we now have
speed. Um, and you can choose whether to
run codecs in standard or fast mode. Um,
fast mode is fantastic. Um, but you
know, it does consume uh your usage a
bit more quickly. Um, and then we have
here I think the ability to toggle some
of the permissions and settings. Um, I
love I've been using local here, but I
love u the workree capability of the
Codex app. So work trees, if you're not

[00:12]
familiar, are essentially like git
sandboxes. uh and they allow you to work
on multiple things simultaneously within
the same folder without stepping on or
or clobbering uh changes in a different
task thread.
>> Yeah, if you've seen folks with, you
know, five screens and 18 t-mox tabs,
work trees is what they're using in
order to kind of go in parallel here.
And I think getting uh your codebase
working with work trees is one of the
steps you can do to move toward a
harness engineering mentality. uh
basically make it really cheap to work
on multiple copies of your code at once.
>> Yeah. Um and the Codex app has a really
great handoff feature where if you're in
a work tree and you do want to bring
those changes back to your local branch,
um you can click a single button to do
so. Or if you want to push them back to
the work tree, you can click a single
button to do so. There's a lot of great
git support in here. This is a pretty
simple repo, so we just have the main
branch. Um but you can, you know, easily
commit and push just from the app. Um,
you can also, uh, you know, open up
these files in your IDE of choice. Um,

[00:13]
and then there's a few built-in, you
know, there's a terminal, so we can take
a look at at what's going on in here.
Um, there's a diff panel. Um, I think in
this case, you know, we've got quite a
lot of changes now. It's written 8,200
lines of code just in the the few
minutes we've been talking. Um,
over on the left, we've got uh the
skills and apps that we were talking
about earlier. um you know really love I
think just the the set of skills that we
that we provide out of the box here um
as well as I think the apps that you can
go ahead and install uh for yourself.
>> One neat thing here with uh Google
Calendar in apps is it kind of uh should
maybe help get you thinking about ways
you can use codeex to automate other
parts of your work other than just the
code that you're writing. Uh I've vied
up a couple of tools to help me digest
my calendar, make sure I'm allocating my
time effectively. uh really cool to
unblock the other parts of my job uh
with this tool.
>> I love that you brought that up. So,
let's talk about automations, right?
Which to me is like the killer feature
for for the Codeex app. Um automations,

[00:14]
and you can kind of see, you know, a lot
of my messy inbox here. Um is a way for
you to uh just run a command on a
regular schedule, right? And it sounds
simple, but I've kind of been surprised
at like how powerful it is in practice.
>> Yes. Yes. Uh, one I run all the time is
to have the Codex app review all my open
PRs and make sure that they're
mergeable, that they haven't come into
conflict with me. Codex is really good
at resolving merge conflicts, and I am
super lazy, so I am more than happy to
delegate this work to Codex to make sure
that I'm always on block to smash the
merge button as soon as my code is
approved.
>> Yeah. Um, in my case, I think my most
popular one is uh Slack management. So,
just checking on, you know, work streams
that I've got going on or updating
to-dos from Slack. Um, I've seen other
folks, you know, at OpenAI use it for
things like, hey, you know, take my most
recent, um, PRs and just review them for
any potential bugs, uh, or, you know,
look at my Git history for the last 24
hours and just surface a quick summary

[00:15]
for standup today.
>> Amazing.
>> Okay, so let's take a look at how the
the app did. It looks like it went ahead
and and built something for us. Um, it
did some testing. It ran, you know, lint
test build. Fantastic. Um, and so we can
go into the repo that I asked it to
make. Um, and let's take a look at what
it's got.
Cool. Um, so it went ahead and, you
know, oneshotted this app for us. Um,
there's a lot going on here, but I'll
kind of give a quick overview. The way
that this is meant to work is we're
going to put in a GitHub repo, uh, and
maybe some custom instructions. Um, it's
going to analyze that GitHub repo. Um,
again, we're using hosted shell. Uh, and
it's going to score it based on these
seven um, metrics for agentic
legibility, right?
>> I wonder what would happen if you put
the Symfony repo in here.
>> Yeah, that's a great call out. So, I
actually had already loaded this up.
Symfony is a repo that we just open
source last week um, alongside this

[00:16]
theme of harness engineering. Um I have
uh previously tested this so I actually
know to tell the model um only score the
elixir folder.
Uh but Ryan, why don't you tell us a
little bit about uh oh missing OpenAI
model. Cool. So I mean I think we
probably need to give it some
environment variables. Uh and let's say
I should have these in
I should have these preloaded. And let's
take another Oops.
Let's take
>> Power of live demos, folks.
>> I know you can never be too confident in
what's going to come back out. All
right, let's try that one more time.
>> I do like that the agent bias toward
configurability, though. That's a nice
touch. Very 12 factor app style.

[00:17]
Okay, it's going ahead. Yeah, why don't
you tell us a little bit about Symfony?
>> So, Symfony is kind of the next step
that came out of the work that we did in
this repo that is very bootstrapped for
harness engineering. And it takes this
idea that if we have enough guard rails
around codeex that it is reliably
producing code that is going to be
accepted by all the human engineers and
agentic reviewers on my team, let's
remove the humans from the loop entirely
on poking at their terminal and instead
have them working at a much higher level
defining work in linear. Um, and
Symphony is an orchestrator that manages
advancing that work through the ticket
queue, making sure that Codeex is spun
up in a work tree, implementing that
code, putting it up for review, going
back and forth with CI and Agentic code
reviewers, and only bringing the humans
into the loop once all our previous
constraints are satisfied. And you know
this allows me to truly focus my time on

[00:18]
the hard stuff prioritizing work
reviewing work and making sure that the
work that we are doing is like acrewing
value to the actual products that we
want to build.
>> Yeah.
>> And it's really nice to be able to give
be given a fully baked PR and be able to
make a cheap yes or no decision on
whether or not can merge and then
Symphony will manage merging it for me.
>> Nice. Um and it looks like yeah this is
reflective of the fact that you have put
a lot of thought into those design
patterns. Uh the our app here gave you a
B-grade on on your agentic legibility.
>> Nailed it.
>> Um there's a few things. So let's take a
look at at what it scored and and its
recommendations, right? So uh bootstrap
self-sufficiency basically uh can the
repo just get, you know, set up from
scratch, right? Do you need to know is
there external knowledge that you might
need to know um or commands that you
might need to run to make this work,
right?
uh task entry points. So is it easy for
the agent to just run, you know, make or
build or lint or that sort of thing,
right? Uh validation harness. Um so how

[00:19]
easily can it check the changes that it
made, right? Um
>> hard to know if you completed the job if
you can't measure that the job is done.
>> Exactly. Um linting and formatting. So I
think this one um it found that you had
a llinter but maybe it wasn't as obvious
to the model like where to find that and
and how to expose that. Um in practice I
think linting is probably for me I think
maybe the biggest like the the best
lowhanging fruit to tackle. Um it just
saves I find in practice it saves like
so many cycles of just like the model
can just check check its work really
cheaply.
>> That's right. And it's super easy to add
leverage to your codebase by vibing up
some new lids. Codeex is really really
good at this.
>> Yeah. Um there's the yeah is there a map
for the agent to take a look at where
things are? Um are docs structured uh
easily and then are there any decision
records present in the in the app?
Right. Um I think in this case this was
the only one that that you guys missed
on.
>> Yeah. Artifact of open sourcing the

[00:20]
things. Sorry folks.
>> But it ground all those. Yeah, it made
those recommendations. Um and you can
see over here, you know, it took um this
is these are logs from the container,
the hosted shell happening in the
background, right? Um, and if we go back
to the codeex app, um, we can see like,
yeah, we actually in firing off this
responses API request, um, we send it a
model, uh, we specified this skill ID
which has all of that knowledge of of
the metrics in the background. Um, and
then we, you know, the team has actually
put a lot of thought into safety and
security around this stuff. Um, it's
it's not trivial to just, you know, sort
of say like, yeah, let's open up all
network access here. Uh, so we did have
to specify a white list of domains that
we wanted the shell to be able to
access. Yeah, I think it's super nice
how high level the container API is and
it allows you to get very good secure
defaults that empower the agent to cook
while maintaining the safety and
security and variance that you want
because you know fundamentally uh these
agents are going to do what they do and

[00:21]
we need to make sure that we put them in
the right environment to do that.
>> Yeah. Um so uh yeah we'll have these
slides here right these are the
legibility metrics that we started on
but ultimately um this was kind of a
oneshot example right it's a single plan
we oneshotted this we vibe coded this
app um I think the more interesting
question is how do you continue to build
bigger things right how do you um how do
you extend that vibe coding session into
into something much much larger
>> that's right uh this is why I'm excited
to talk today about harness engineering
kind of what it is what we learned while
kind of operating on a project that my
team took on for about five months where
we had the hard constraint that no
humans would write any lines of code. So
we ended up with a product that we're
shipping internally today uh that is
about a million lines of code uh where
all of it 100% of it has been written by
codeex and this is been kind of a very

[00:22]
interesting experience as an engineer
here because I can't actually clack on
the keyboard in order to make progress.
I kind of have to step back and think at
a systems level of how to enable my team
of agents to go do the thing. And agents
see the world and code slightly
differently than the humans I would
normally have on my team. So over the
course of this project, we have been
figuring out a bunch of patterns on how
to refine the output of these coding
agents so we can get to merge over and
over again.
And so one might imagine, one might
assume that a million lines of code
entirely written by agents. That's got
to be a hot mess, right? That's got to
be, you know, like how do you manage
that and and and you know, make sure
it's good.
>> Yeah. I believe the term uh for this is
AI slop. And one thing that's great
because code is now so much cheaper to
produce than before. You can simply just
say I do not tolerate AI slop, which to

[00:23]
me is slang for code I don't like.
Right? If you can articulate what it is
about the code you don't like, the next
step is to write that down in
documentation or in a bespoke code
reviewer agent or in tests or lints. If
you can say what it is you don't like
about the code that's being produced,
you can work toward encoding those
non-functional requirements in your
codebase to just ban that code from
happening in the first place. One nice
example I have here is one common
pattern we see is that the coding agents
like to optimize for local ease of use
which means you can end up with several
copies of the same routine in your
codebase. One thing that has happened is
we end up with very many copies of a
bounded concurrency helper. Uh but only
one of them is one we've invested in to
instrument with our open telemetry
stack. So we have a lint that basically
bans this function of various shapes
from being defined anywhere else except

[00:24]
our canonical async utils package. And
this is just a vibecoded eslint rule
which we can assert is 100% covered
because we can just do that which makes
codeex exhaustively write tests for the
positive and negative cases here. And
this is kind of what it means to dive
deeper into the systems thinking within
your codebase. observe the mistakes or
classes of misbehavior that the agents
are making and do what it takes in order
to just statically disallow them. Um,
this has been really really cool because
this allows us to actually encode what
it means to have trusted engineering in
the code. It's just not possible for AI
slop to enter the codebase. And one
other neat thing is that these things
have stacked incredibly well, right? We
have kind of observed that as we have
onboarded engineers to the team, they
have a different set of experiences and
ideas of what good highquality correct

[00:25]
code looked like. Uh which means that
each one of the engineers that has
joined my team is able to reduce sloth
in a unique way. But because everyone is
invested in putting that knowledge into
the codebase, it means everyone else's
coding agents have the best guts of
everyone on the team. Um, one neat thing
is um Oh yeah, maybe we can go to
>> Yeah, why don't we why don't we look at
dig into some of that that codeex usage.
>> Yeah. So um I think when we started this
was very very slow, right? like
codeex did not have a good idea of what
my acceptance criteria was. So I often
had to double click into a task to build
some building blocks to get the refined
output that I actually wanted. But once
I had invested in those building blocks,
I went from maybe a quarter or half an
engineer's worth of throughput at the
beginning to three to 10 engineers worth
of throughput per engineer. And one

[00:26]
other neat thing here is that as I have
added members to my team, our throughput
has actually increased because we have
that flywheel of subsequent knowledge
that every engineer has impacting
everyone's coding agents for the better.
Another neat thing here is because the
only way to get code that is accepted is
to get the coding agent to do it. We
have had to pull a ton more context into
the repository than I otherwise would
have in the past. Uh a good example here
is I partnered with our security
engineering team to upgrade our app to
the blessed cryptography library that we
support. But that decision happened in a
Slack thread buried in our team channel
two months ago. We hired a new engineer
onto the team and they were mcking
around in this part of the code and
brought in a new npm package for some of
this functionality. I knew when I
reviewed the code that this was not uh
aligned with our engineering practices.
But this is not the engineer's fault.

[00:27]
It's not Codex's fault. That information
just wasn't encoded in the constraints
of our system. So I went back to that
Slack thread. I did at@codeex please add
guardrails to our codebase reflected
that knowledge back in and then redid
the change which then resulted in more
aligned output because it used the bless
cryptography library that we were
supposed to.
>> Wow. Okay. And so it sounds like then
you're heavily relying on these
integrations these these apps right into
uh Slack or Linear or whatever else to
get context back and forth.
>> Yeah. And it's super super cheap to do
this right. I at codeex I go away for 5
10 15 minutes and I come back with four
proposed PRs on how we can make our code
higher and higher quality in the in the
future.
The other pattern that I think was
really really neat is
we have a lot of context in the codebase
too much to put in an agent.mmd file. uh
just talking about our security best
practices is a 250 line markdown file.

[00:28]
Same for what it means to write reliable
code. I'm sure all of you in uh your
past have gotten a page that was
resolved by adding a retry and a timeout
to uh some network code and we all know
this but still code ends up in
production that does not have retries
and timeouts and code produced by codecs
is the same. So kind of writing that
non-functional requirement down, giving
the agent pointers in agents.mmd on how
it can look at our best practices for
reliability and then reflecting that
back into the agent in a reliable way
via a code reviewer operationalize
around reliability who leaves comments
on PRs that our primary authoring agent
is forced to read means that we can kind
of steer the system to converge around
our set of guardrails in a way that's
actually higher for reliability than
having the humans do it. Codeex is very
very patient and willing to take as many
code reviews as we can throw at it
whereas I might get frustrated and just

[00:29]
yolo merge it anyway. Uh so we do end up
with very high quality code as a result
of this here. Uh another neat thing is
um this stacks very very well. Um, we
had a new engineer join our teams, very
product minded and was frustrated that
Codex was not able to effectively smoke
test changes to critical user journey
flows in our app. So pointed codeex at
the codebase, asked it to spider through
all of our uh userf facing features,
write product specs for them, write
manual QA plans, write the user needs
that these flows address, and then
pushed it into a bespoke reviewer agent
to look at every PR and generate a
manual QA plan, which again codeex is
able to look at in order to validate
that its changes work end to end and are
aligned with our app's functionality.
And what I find really fascinating about
this sort of setup is, you know,
normally these things, they maybe exist
in Slack or in conversations. Um, but
we've never sort of had the ability like

[00:30]
we've never taken the time to actually
write them all down and encode them in
our code repositories. Um, but to your
point about it is now so cheap to to
generate these things, right? Um, that
that is kind of a new avenue of of
documentation.
>> Yeah. If you want Codeex to be an
effective member of your team, you
needed to know all the things it takes
in order to have acceptable code in
order to merge. It really is about the
non-functional requirements in order to
get truly aligned output from these
agents.
So, I talked about this a little bit
here, but as we have onboarded new folks
to our team, they each bring their own
experience and expertise. I myself bias
more toward backend infra and
architecture. uh which means I just did
not have the knowhow in order to get
high quality react code out of codecs.
Uh but as soon as we hired someone with
deep front-end architecture experience
and they started reflecting that
knowledge into the codebase, now all of
a sudden hooks were getting decomposed

[00:31]
to a single hook per file. We were
getting small components that were
easily testable via snapshot testing and
composed together well uh to have
smaller files that are more efficient
for the agent to page into context. And
with each subsequent engineer on the
team, they encode more and more of their
taste and expertise, which means
everybody's coding agents get more
effective.
>> That's so cool.
So uh some key tips on how you might
apply some of these patterns uh in your
own work. Uh you should check out the
codeex repo which already has much of
this in it. Just clone it and ask codeex
to explain how it is structured and to
teach you about the best practices that
the team has used. Another cool thing
that I'm seeing all over X right now is
folks are literally taking the link to
the harness engineering blog giving it
to codeex in their repository and say
make my codebase more agent legible make
it do this and folks are getting good

[00:32]
results that is improving the autonomy
quality and long horizon task execution
of codecs. Uh super super cool that we
can essentially ship prompts to the
world uh to help uh everyone be more
effective with codecs. Yeah, and I love
that it's this shift like we're saying
from from you know coding in on the
keyboard to now orchestrating right at
that next level which Symfony. That's
right. That's how we get to the repo
name.
>> That's right.
>> All right. Uh then I will hand it over
back to Christine.
>> Awesome. Thank you guys for walking us
through that. Um and now for our
customer spotlight. Really excited to
welcome Mitch, the co-founder of Basis.
Uh, so we're gonna pop out of this
screen share and then Mitch should be
joining us on stage.
>> Cool.
How do I stop screen?
>> Yeah, there we go.
>> Hey guys, thanks for having me.
>> Hey Mitch,
>> I'm think I'm gonna be saying a lot of
the similar things.

[00:33]
>> Perfect. Uh, you were just muted there
for a sec.
>> Okay, great. I was just saying I think
I'm going to be saying a lot of the same
stuff Ryan and and co have been saying
on putting stuff in the repo and
whatnot, but this will be a fun a fun
discussion. Um, let me see if I can
share my screen. So, I had Codeex
make
a quick presentation here. Can you guys
see that? Yeah. So I'm just going to
quickly go through talk about some of
some of the stuff we do which I think is
very similar to some of the harness
engineering work um and uh both on how
we do it for engineering in our codebase
but also actually at the company level
um and how I think you can think about
using codecs beyond um just even the
codebase. So
I think the the first thing that's
really important um and let's talk about
the codebase first and we'll talk about
that company after is
actually and I realized let me give a
quick introduction of myself. So I'm
Mitch I'm one of the two co-founders of
of Basis. I um Basis essentially is an

[00:34]
agent platform for accountants. Um we
recently raised a a series B uh and we
are very very focused on um engineering
our company in such a way that we can
move extremely fast. And the reason I
always tell people this is so important
is that our ambitions are so large that
if you actually think about the scale we
need to be at in very short periods of
time, it would literally be beyond the
laws of physics to be able to hire that
many people. And uh so we can't rely on
that. instead you have to really
engineer your company and your codebase
to be able to um you know have as much
output uh as if you were you know a
company that was 10x the size. Um so
going kind of back onto um uh the
codebase side doing that I think really
does require a big mindset shift. So,
and part of what you guys just heard
about from like the symphony side is
people need to be able to shift from
doing to managing. And I think that's
actually a very hard um paradigm shift
to make and different people uh are able

[00:35]
to get to it at different kind of uh
different speeds. But that shift doesn't
really it's hard to make people make
that shift whether it's engineers doing
it or people on the sales team or or the
post sales team if uh the agents aren't
actually working well. So, it's hard to
go and convince someone, hey, like, you
know, go, you should just have, let's
say, this agent write the code if the
agent isn't actually writing the code.
Well, number one, and two, you have to
have the mindset shift about how do you
build for agents, not just for people,
right? You want agents to have the
ability to self-verify. You want them to
be able to um uh understand like what
the different intents are uh that people
are are giving them. And even then, if
you're in a production codebase or in a
larger company, you need abilities to
collaborate so that one person's
preference of how some agent behaves
doesn't now go and override another
person's preference. And so, you really
have to go and build this up. So,
what do you actually need to be true at
the codebase level for this to work? You

[00:36]
need to have good standards in terms of
how you want the code to be written.
That needs to be turned into good
context. And then you need to have good
processes around this to make sure that
context is kept up to date. And then you
need internal setup that's easy to
operate. Right? If you have a bunch of
uh dev tooling that none of which has
MCPs or ways to integrate in with your
agents, then they're not going to be
able to actually uh you know validate
their work or use the same tooling that
a developer would. So we for example you
know at basis we we have something
called satellite that we made which is a
single MCP that essentially wraps all
other MCPs so that developers only has
to integrate with one MCP rather than
having to integrate with like 50. Um
just as an example of that kind of
thing.
Why is codec really good at this? So I
think the specifically for production
code bases if you want the agents to be
really good you need to get really good
at instruction following and codeex is
very good at instruction following to

[00:37]
the point that actually it forces you I
think to be even more precise in your uh
documentation and more precise in your
context so that um codeex follows our
instructions. You need to be Codex is
really good at gathering context ahead
of time, right? Ryan was talking earlier
about like the progressive disclosure.
That's, you know, if you're going to
have lots of progressive disclosure,
which is really important for any level
of complexity, you want the model and
the harness to be good at um uh going
through that progressive disclosure to
gather the context it needs to do tasks.
Codex is excellent at that, right? And
so it'll constantly go out and and do
that. And um you need to be good at just
making decisions uh in that areas of
ambiguity. And Codex is really good at
that.
So
let's talk a little bit about basis and
I'll I'll go into a couple demos here of
how we do this in terms of how do we
kind of set those standards. So we focus
on a couple things. We focus on agents
MDs. Uh so we have an agent MD at the
root and then we have agents MD in
different modules throughout the
codebase with the kind of principle that

[00:38]
if the information is specific to that
module then you can put it into that
modules agents.mmd versus if it's you
know maybe generic across modules you
would put it into um uh into a skill and
let's see what else I have here. Yeah.
So
I think it's super super important that
you set these standards, you treat them
as uh kind of canonical and then you
build the processes to keep them
updated. So maybe I'll show you one
quick example here. Um I'm not going to
show uh I'm going have to be careful
here going into the live stream on what
I can demo, but just to show let's say
here. So this is a this is a skill that
I have. You can see agent skill. It's
called paper updating. I'll explain what
paper is in a second here. But this is a
skill that we have um on how to on how
to you know go and update something
internally we call paper. And uh the key
here is that there is an owner
right there who is put on the skill as

[00:39]
part of the front matter. And what that
means is that you can have very distinct
responsibility for uh what who is
responsible for different skills. So
that for example, let's say you were
running, you know, um an agent that was
going to go and look at the different
skills and uh see, hey, are there any
skills that have like descriptions that
conflict with each other? Well, uh
making sure that the um the skill that
if it it knows who the owners are, so
you can like slack them or something
like that. And then which gets to this
internal tool that we've built called
paper, which I'll just show you for a
second here. Um, so paper is essentially
a way to if you're going to have all of
the context in the repository, which we
want to do, and our our monor repo is
called Arnold because that's that's what
we called it. Um, fun fact, when I came
up with that, it was because uh Arnold
was the most popular name of an
accountant in the US according to
ChachiBT in like 2023. So that's why
it's called Arnold. Um, so if I go to

[00:40]
paper and just show this to you quickly.
Um, so here is
is paper and like as you can see we
have, you know, codebased engineering,
engineering at at bases. I'm not going
to show you all the different skills,
but I already have it preset up the
skill I was just looking at here. So
it's very clear who the owner is, what
the flow is, and you kind of go and sort
of see it. And this allows you to really
easily, at least for us, um, be able to,
uh, make sure that you're not getting
slop into the codebase, that you
actually are keeping it updated, that
people are actually looking at the
skills and, uh, able to kind of go and
read it.
So, that's just like an example of that
of of kind of do how we h have skills.
And then we also use sub agents. Codeex
as of recently supports sub agents.
Codex is really really good at enforcing
standards for sub agents. We use sub
agents very heavily, actually. Um so
some of the sub sub aents that we use is
we use um uh we have a specific sub
agent whose job it is to enforce
standards. So codeex you know it'll do a
pass and then it'll go and call the you

[00:41]
know standards enforcer sub agent um if
there's any uh things that codex might
have missed in terms of our standards.
Um we have a sub agent for uh
helping you know uh babysit pull
requests in case there's like you know
Codex wants to send someone off to go do
that. And so sub agents I think are a
really really good way to take flows
that um Codex is amazing at but you want
to be really sure and put that in a
specialized sub agent that Codex can go
and call.
See what else we have. So couple other
quick things here and then I'll go into
a couple more quick demos. So I think
it's really important that agents have
the opportunity to actually verify their
own work. So, uh, in the end of the day,
you need to be able to have, uh, if if
you want, you know, codeex is really
good for going for long periods of time.
And one of the things it's really good
at is using tools and context to sort of
make sure it's doing a good job. So, you
need to give it ways to do a good job,
right? And that includes tests. Can it
quickly run tests against the work it's
doing so that it can validate itself?
One flow that I like doing a lot is

[00:42]
having a more test-driven development
approach to things where you don't just
have a product spec, but you actually
have a list of tests um that Codeex can
go and generate for you that outline
kind of the intent of the change so that
Codex can go and ensure that the
different user flows that it is um uh
that it is making actually work by the
time it comes back to you.
Okay. And lastly here,
I think one of the the big things that
starts to happen once you actually have
codeex, let's say writing all the code
and is able to go and um uh execute
things really well is that decision-m
starts to become the main bottleneck on
your velocity, right? So we have been
trying to do things on our setup that
allows for decision-m to actually start
become faster as well in working with
codecs. So one of the things we do is we
have this concept of dotnotes and
dotnotes is essentially a way where if
you're working with codeex and you have
some decision and you know let's say you
told codex hey actually you should be
doing it like this codeex will put

[00:43]
decisions that were happening throughout
the session it will put those in dot
notes um which is like a part of the
repository just to like streamline
decisions you can sort of think of it
like commit messages but commit messages
that codeex can write to whenever it
wants rather than only when it is making
a commit which creates a full kind of
history um for every commit of what were
the decisions made in that session that
you can use um as a historical kind of
debugger. So if you're going back to a
historical commit, you can say, well,
wait a second. Why did codeex or whoever
made this commit, you know, implement it
this way, not this way. You can look at
the note in the notes folder, and it
will tell you that. And obviously specs
that live in the repo is really, really
key. So as a quick example of that, um
I'll show you here, I have a a hero
product spec um that I put for paper as
kind of an example here. You know, if
you kind of go on GitHub, it's sort of a
little um uh not exactly the greatest
easiest thing to read. it's hard to
leave comments. Uh if I go here, it's,
you know, it looks okay. And so one of
the things we built internally because

[00:44]
we have this internal app called paper
is the ability to go and collaborate on
specs right inside of your codebase. So
I can go um here for example, and this
is now the the spec I'm looking at. I
can go and leave a comment test codeex
comment.
And
this will now go and leave a comment
that that is actually directly in the um
in the inside the codebase. And so all
of the um the commenting, all of the
resolutions, all of the interactions,
all of the planning actually happens
literally inside of the codebase. You
see now it says refresh um um literally
happen inside the codebase. And if you
go to here, you'll see the comments. So
it's just a cool like internal tool we
built. The reason for this is
specifically for the purpose of uh as
kind of Ryan was talking about bringing
stuff inside of the codebase so that we
can um have as much context there as
possible so that codeex has all the
context it needs to go and help us make
decisions and implement things.

[00:45]
And then lastly and then I'll I'll
Christine I'll hand it off uh to you is
I think it is really important to not
stop at the codebase. So you'll note
here that I didn't have time to go
actually give Codex the screenshots I
told it it would give it. Um for the
company we think about this kind of
mindset of having context uh in the
codebase not just as a production code
question. We think of this as a company
context question. So we have two repos
in our company. One is called Arnold
which is our monor repo and the other is
called Atlas. And Atlas is the monor
repo of all the company context that is
not in our um uh the production repo.
And for example things like if I go here
uh things like
where was it things like so here I'm in
the atlas not Arnold this is in paper
again but like here are some of our
operating principles um which you can go
and you know look on our careers page
for example um and our operating
principles you see like who the owner of
that is and having that very very

[00:46]
clearly in a codebase because now say
you're trying to work with codeex to
help plan well can go and help and read
all the information about the company in
order to help um uh make decisions about
different things. And so I think once
you start realizing this, you can do a
lot more. And so maybe I'll just show
you one quick example what that allows
you to do. Let me quickly share a
different part of my screen here. If I
were to go and actually pull up Codeex,
um
let me
pull it up. And I am uh since we used
the app earlier, I'll use the CLI
quickly. Um
so in this case, hey, this is the me
making the the PowerPoint earlier. Um so
if I'm here, like I for example have a
skill in my personal that's called start
my day.

[00:47]
And what start my day will do,
it's going to run through my morning
routine. It's going to grab all the
context from the last 24 hours, refresh
a bunch of different things, do
weekends, etc., etc. So, I'm not going
to actually let it run because then
it'll show some information, but um
allows you to kind of go and it can do
this really, really well because it has
all of the context that it needs both
from my personal notes, our kind of
company repository, and uh from Arnold.
So, I will uh I'll pause there and give
it back to you, Christine.
Awesome.
Thanks so much. Um, so we have about 10
minutes left for Q&A. Mitch, if you want
to stay on, we had some come in through
the chat specifically for you. Um, and
we'll just back into the screen share.
Cool. Okay. Um, first question, Mitch.
Um, how did you use Codex to generate
the deck?

[00:48]
Yeah, that uh you you can go and like
have it make PowerPoint in Python, but
that was just HTML. So, I just told it
to make HTML and I uh voice voiceed um
all the context about the thing I wanted
and uh if you notice it used I think it
used opening eyes fonts. I told it to go
find what the opening eye fonts are and
find a similar one.
>> I I do this all the time too. It's uh
super good at just vibing a bunch of
single page React slides into place and
doing a pretty good job at it.
>> Oh, totally. Yeah.
>> Nice. Okay, next question says, "Shout
out to Mitch. Met you at an event in New
York City. This is awesome. Um, few
questions. So, is there any
checkpointing or the ability to revert
and from a management perspective, is
there any plans for collaboration
features like shared threads? Can Codex
execute browser previews or browser
automations?"
>> Uh, I can take that last one. So CODC
can definitely execute browser
automations. There's a playright skill
that's been around for a little bit and
then we just released a playwright
interactive skill which I think takes it

[00:49]
even further in terms of the depth that
Codex can go in in using the browser.
Personally I do it whenever I'm doing
front end um you know if I have feedback
for Codex if it's gotten a box wrong or
an alignment wrong I'll tell it use
playright and just keep iterating and
like screenshot it until you feel
confident that you've got it correct.
Um I think the other one's for in terms
of checkpointing um and and shared
threads. I'm not sure about shared
threads. I think that's that's a great
question. Um in terms of ability to
revert in the app, uh you have the like
everything shows up as sort of staged
files. So it's very easy or unstage
files. So it's very easy to just click
and sort of stage stuff or you can
simply tell you know codeex or have it
in your agents MD like get commit
everything as you go. Right. And I think
once you set up that scaffold um it can
take care of itself.
>> Yeah. I definitely let codeex commit its
own work and uh I give it a skills for
what our expectations are around commit
messages and the progress and the
granularity of those commits works
pretty well.

[00:50]
>> Okay, next question. Um as we move from
AI pair programming to full agent
delegation, what are the key design
patterns that make an agent reliable
enough for production systems?
So what I've found here is it is highly
beneficial to put in pretty rigid
architecture patterns that you would
expect to deploy in a company of a
thousand or 10,000 engineers which means
uh I have dived really heavily into
separation of concerns proper package
layering um making sure that business
domains have high cohesion and
encapsulation and boundary separation
uh and this helps with context
management right if you're working in
one set of business logic and the agent
can take as given an opaque interface
that it can rely on invariance for right
you know for example if I am building a
um you know a task summarization feature
as a core set of business logic if it

[00:51]
can accept a dependency of inference
right it doesn't have to deeply
understand it. I've limited the amount
of context the agent needs to page in.
And this is sort of the same pattern as
discressive progressive disclosure that
we're doing in the docs. So being able
to structure the codebase in a highly
opinionated way also permits those code
as prompts to follow the same sort of
pattern.
>> Cool.
>> Yeah, we we by the way did like far more
refactors I think than you would have
five years ago because of this. Uh so I
totally agree.
Okay, next question says, "How does your
team maintain agent instructions? Does
each engineer provide their own personal
set of instructions or does uh
instructions get shared version
controlled? How does your how does the
team sync up on adding or improving
instructions?"
So everything lives in the codebase
which means at least on my team we have
very few personal agents MDs or personal

[00:52]
skills and we treat this as a way to
encode leverage for all the agents that
is are operating on my team's behalf. Um
also we have not we have collected
around only a handful of skills that are
pretty general right we have a skill for
making PRs we have a skill for landing
changes and deploying them we have a
skill for making commits a skill for
doing code review a skill for analyzing
the architecture of proposed plans and
really that's it. um any additional
leverage we want to give the agent
either goes into reference documentation
that goes with those skills, scripts
that go with those skills or the
documentation and tests in the
repository itself. And this has the
benefit of getting things out of
individual teammates heads and into a
space where everybody's agents can
benefit in terms of sharing knowledge.
Uh we have bias toward really high
frequency in-person standups. We have 30
minute standoff every day which is maybe

[00:53]
something that's a little bit different
from how folks have been working
recently but the code velocity is so
high and each of the engineers is
disconnected enough from the code that
it can be weeks before I realize like
core architectural patterns have
changed. So bringing those to
synchronous time for the humans to
collaborate has uh made a ton of sense
for us.
>> Uh Mitch, is there anything different
that that the basis team does here?
>> No, I think it's all the same. I the
thing I'd actually be curious to ask
about is the is the thinking between
putting some of those do like front end
or backend standards into docs versus
like a skill. Um or it's maybe just kind
of uh you know marginal but we we we put
a lot of that in skills. Um and then we
have docs as meant to be docs kind of
meant for humans. Um and then uh
obviously still useful for agents but we
for now keep a lot of that in the uh in
the scale. So there would be like a
front-end skill that the agent you know
codex anytime it's touching any front
end code will go and look at it and that

[00:54]
will have a bunch of references under it
that will uh you know have specifics on
different parts of the front end
depending on what it's doing um assuming
that it's not completely scoped to um
like a module in which case it's it'll
be in the agent.
Yeah, we have uh instead put all of that
uh task specific expertise in the
documentation hierarchy and instead
focused the skills on highle operating
modes. So like we'll have a principal
review uh skill that you know the human
can then steer to look at specific
documentation but is otherwise just a
general mode with which codeex should be
the task.
>> Cool. That's cool.
uh work tree sounds cool. Can you demo
that quickly? Sure. Yeah, let's take a
quick look. Uh let's go back to codeex.
So the way the work trees uh work, so
right now we just pick a new work tree.
Um and then I'll just say um you know
modify the plan MD um to like to be

[00:55]
shorter, right? Uh and the idea here I'm
going to toggle off plan mode and I'll
put it on low just so it's fast. Um, but
you saw briefly there created a new work
tree. Uh, and then now it's going to go
ahead and um start making uh yeah, it's
smart enough to know that it should read
it. Um,
but it's going to take a look. Uh, and I
think it's looking for which one it
should edit, right? Um, because we
previously had some archive ones. Um,
but basically one thing that didn't
happen in this branch is we didn't bring
in automatically um our existing diffs,
right? So like all of the changes that
happen here locally um are currently
separate from this work tree. And so
that way I can work on this branch
there. There's an option to bring those
changes if you want them. Uh but by
default, you know, it'll it'll take the
clean main checkout or whatever branch
you want. Um and go ahead and do it. So
it's going to modify these these files.
Uh and then we'll have the ability to
either spin off a branch and create it

[00:56]
later. um or once it starts making diffs
and if you're on a separate branch it'll
decide whether you want to hand those
off to uh to your local environment.
>> Yeah, the way to think about this is I
can have multiple working directories
with multiple different branches of the
repository uh on my file system at the
same time without having to clone the
repo multiple times and like these
commands are pretty fiddly. Uh I hate
using them. So it's great that Codex app
is just going to do this for me.
>> So it made a bunch of changes here. Um
but you know those are not going to be
reflected in our in our main thread.
>> Okay, next question. We'll just rapid
fire through these as we're almost at
time. Um due to progressive disclosure,
should you just enable all skills so
they can be called if needed?
>> I would say yes. Um, the thing to invest
in is short, highquality descriptions
that live in the front matter of those
skills because that's going to kind of
be the teaser that the model gets to
determine whether or not it should
invoke a particular skill. Um, so we

[00:57]
kind of get to go from a short little
snippet describing what capabilities are
available to the detailed instructions
the model should follow.
Yeah, we actually have a codec sub agent
whose entire what it does is it can uh
spin off um like it can spin off
versions of the sub agent that will test
for different skills. So it'll like give
examples of different instructions uh
and see if it actually triggered the
skill if the sub agent grabbed the skill
or not as a way to kind of like pseudo
test pseudo test if the front matter
descriptions work well.
>> Um and then Ryan, what about specific
skills in our library?
Um,
uh, which library?
>> Uh, this was just a follow-up question
for,
uh, the app store.
>> Oh, um, I really like using the Figma
skill. Uh, it's super super neat to be
able to to close the loop from work that
other members of my team are doing to
pull that context into codeex. In the
same way, we're doing all these tricks
with Slack uh, to bring context into the

[00:58]
codebase as well.
>> Nice. Okay. Um, I'm curious if any work
was put into creating a bootstrap for
harness engineering on a brownfield
application, for example, documentation
management, generic rules and
conventions, and if not, what sort of
specific implementation details could
you advise us on?
>> Yeah, so I would say we are still
actively figuring out uh what it means
to deploy these techniques into a
brownfield codebase. And this is
something we're super happy to
collaborate with the community on uh to
figure out what works. uh but in general
the techniques we've been doing are to
carve apart parts of the repository into
isolated business logic domains add
interfaces add highquality local set of
documentation on the best practices that
every member of the team that owns this
code is looking for. So we have been
having individual doc sub trees that are
close to the code that's being modified
using that same sort of structure that
we lay out.
And yes, turn on all the lints you can.

[00:59]
>> Okay. Do you have any resources or
examples for these MD prompt files to
help guide codecs with longunning tasks?
Um, I mean, I'll let Ryan answer, but I
think all the all the the skills we've
had, the metrics that we've shown, and
the code for the the sample app, we're
going to have that in the build hours
GitHub repository. So, you can take a
look at um how we're asking the model to
grade uh these MD prompt files.
>> Yeah. And I'll drop those links um after
this session and um in a follow-up
email. Uh Mitch, there were some
questions for you, too. People were
really interested in your slide deck as
well as paper.
Uh, one thing I'll say is to see these
files, what reliability looks like for
your codebase, what security looks like,
what front-end component architecture
looks like. I'd say just sit down as a
team and rapid fire throw some bullets
on a whiteboard around what you think
good looks like. And these can be pretty
high level, right? Like something like
secure code has secure interfaces that

[01:00]
are impossible to misuse is just
something you should write down. Uh, and
just getting a couple of files in the
codebase that have the seeds of this
makes it really, really easy to
incrementally add to them. So, take the
time as a team to figure out what look
good looks like for you.
>> Cool. Um, yeah, like I said, it'll be in
GitHub. Um, cool.
>> Awesome. And with that, we will wrap up.
Here are some more additional resources,
but again, I will send them out post
session. Um, and then just a quick plug
on upcoming build hours. On the next
slide, you will see we have two coming
up. One on on agent capabilities that's
happening March 24th and then GBT
realtime 1.5 on April 15th. Um follow
this link below. That's our homepage.
You can find past recorded sessions as
well as sign up for everything that's
coming up. And with that, we will wrap
up. Um thank you so much for attending
and thanks Mitch for joining us. Have a
good one.
>> Thanks fam. Happy building.
