<summary>자막: Building OpenAI o1 (Extended Cut) (22:13)</summary>

[00:00]
all right I'm Bob McGrew I lead the
research team here at open aai we've
just released a preview of our new
series of models 01 and 01 mini which we
are very excited about and we've got the
whole team here to tell you about them
what exactly is 01 so we're starting a
series of new models uh with the new
name oan this is to highlight the fact
that you might feel different when you
use o as a compared to previous models
such as GPT 40 as others will explain
later o1 is a reasoning model so it will
think more before answering your
question we are releasing two models o1
preview which is to preview what's
coming for 01 and 01 mini which is a
smaller and faster model that is trained
with a similar framework as o1 so we
hope you like our new naming scheme o1

[00:01]
so what what is reasoning anyway so one
way of thinking of reasoning is that
there are times where we ask questions
and we need answers immediately because
there are simple questions for example
if you ask what's the capital of Italy
you know the answer is Rome and you
don't really have to think about it much
but if you um Wonder um about a complex
puzzle or you want to write a really
good business plan you want to write a
novel you probably want to think about
it for a while and the more you think
about it the better the outcome so
reasoning is the ability of turning
thinking time into better outcomes
whatever the task you're doing so how
long have you guys been working on this
early on at open AI we were very
inspired by the alpha go results and the
potential of deep reinforcement
learning and so we were researching that
heavily and we saw great scaling on daa
and Robotics and we were thinking about
how H H how can we how can we do
reinforcement learning on a general
domain to get to a very capable
artificial
intelligence and then we saw

[00:02]
the amazing results of scaling on
supervised learning in the GPD Paradigm
and so ever since we've been thinking
about how do we combine this two
different paradigms into one yeah and
it's hard to point to one exact instance
where this whole effort got started but
you know we've had early Explorations
with yakob and Shimon we've had early
Explorations with lukash Ilia and of
course like I think one moment in time
here is consolidating things with Jerry
and um having him build out this large
scale effort here so I mean it's been
going on for a long time but I think
what's really cool about research is
there's that aha moment there's that
particular point in time where something
surprising happens and things really
click together are there any times for
you all when there was you had that aha
moment like we trained gpt2 gpt3 GPT 4
there was the first moment when the one
was hot of the press we started talking
to the model people were like wow this
this mod is really great and starting
doing doing something like that and I
think that there was a certain moment in
our in our training process where we
trained like put more comput in our than
before and train first mod generating

[00:03]
coherent chains of thought and we so wow
this this looks like something
meaningfully different than before and I
think I think for me this is the moment
uh wow related to that uh when we think
about like training a model for
reasoning uh one thing that immediately
jumps to mind is you could have humans
write out their thought process and
train on that when aha moment for me was
like when we saw that if you train the
model using RL to generate and hone its
own chain of thoughts it can do even
better than having humans right chains
of thought for it and that was in aha
moment that you could really scale this
uh and explore models reasoning that way
for a lot of the time that I've been
here we've been trying to make the
models better at solving math problems
as an example and we've put a lot of
work into this and we've come up with a
lot of different methods but one thing
that I kept like every time I would read
these outputs from the models I'd always
be so frustrated the model just would
never seem to question what was wrong or
when it was making mistakes or things
like that but one of these early uh 01
models when we trained it and we
actually started talking to it we
started asking it these questions and it
was scoring higher on these math tests
we were giving it we could look at how
it was reasoning um and you could just

[00:04]
see that it started to question itself
and have really interesting reflection
um and that was a moment for me where I
was like wow like we we've uncovered
something different this is going to be
something new and and it was just like
one of these coming together moments
that that that was really powerful so
when you when you read the the the
thoughts do they does it feel like
you're watching a human or does it feel
like you're watching a robot it's like a
spiritual
experience it's a spiritual experience
but then you can empathize with them all
like oh that's a mistake that a lot of
people would make or you can see it sort
of questioning common conventions and
yeah it's it's spiritual but like oddly
human in in its
Behavior it it was also pretty cool at
some point when uh when we have seen in
cases where there was like a limited
amount of thinking allowed for the model
that just before the timeout the was
like I'm like I have to finish it now
and like here's the answer I spent a lot
of time doing uh competition math when I

[00:05]
was young and that was really my whole
reason for getting into AI was to try
and automate this process and uh so it's
been very like a huge full circle moment
for me to see the model actually be able
to follow through like very close to the
same steps I would use when solving
these problems um and that's you know
it's not exactly the same chain I
thought I would say but very very
relatable it's also really cool to you
know it's believable that these models
they are getting on the Casp of really
advancing engineering and science
and if they seem to be like solving the
problems are you know maybe we can call
ourselves experts hard for us then maybe
they will be even hard for some other
experts and could Advance science so
we've talked a lot about some of the the
Great Moments and the times and
everything just clicked what are some of
the hurdles what are some of the places
where it was actually really hard to
make things work training large models
is fundamentally a very very hard thing
to do and there are like thousands
things that can go wrong and there are
there are at least like hundreds that
did go wrong in every every training R

[00:06]
so almost everyone here like you know
put a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears in in
training those those things and figuring
out how to how how to keep them continue
learning and improving on a path is
actually the path of success is very
narrow and the ways of failure are
plentiful it's like imagine like having
a the center for launching a rocket to
the let's say some planet Moon or so and
if you are off by one angle you won't
arrive at the destination and that's our
job so so the model we said is is very
good often times better than humans like
has equivalent of several phds and that
is sometimes a challenge because we have
to often go and verify that the model
isn't going off the rails doing
something s sensible and it started
taking some serious time as we scal the
model uh we were saturating out all the
industry uh grade evals and we don't
know what to look for next so that is
also a challenge yeah I do think all of

[00:07]
these things we ran into it's also been
one point of fulfillment it's like uh
you know every time you have a puzzle
it's like another hurdle for this team
to overcome and I'm really glad with all
the little hurdles that we've overcome
so what what are some of the ways you
tested the models did you have any
favorite questions that you saw the
model get better at how many hours are
in
ster for whatever reason the Jud GPT
wasn't able to solve this question
reliably but oh one like you know we did
like a year and a half work like a Lar
and now we can count the number of Arts
in Strawberry we should have just
hardcoded that wayu
reliably I have this habit which I think
other people here do too of whenever you
go on Twitter and you see some post
that's like large language models can't
do this you copy and paste it in and
then you said confirm that our
large uh can do this to give people a
sense of what they can use the model for
I'd love to hear some of the ways that
you use 01 so uh one way I've been using

[00:08]
o1 is for obviously coding and a lot of
my job is about coding so the U more and
more I focus on the problem definition
and use this what's called a TD test
driven development so instead of writing
the code that implements the
functionality I focus on writing say the
unit test that specify what is correct
behavior of this piece of code to pass
and so because I can focus on more that
and then pass it on to1 to really
implements the thing I can focus on this
what's important what's the high level
problems um to solve and so on so this
has been really a important way of
Shifting my focus and another area is
debugging so now when I get some error
messages I just pass to oan and then it
just prints out something sometimes it
solves right away even if it doesn't it
at least give some better questions to
ask and uh provide some ways to think
about this problem better so it has
really important change of um working uh

[00:09]
for me and I hope this helps others too
I like using a one more and more for
learning the more I ask it's like
various complex technical subjects I
find hallucinate less and explain
better those Concepts on previous
models for me I like to use o1 as like a
brainstorming partner so that can range
from anything from like a how to solve
some very specific ml problem machine
learning problem to like how to write uh
a blog post or or a tweet so uh for
example I I recently wrote a blog post
about language model evaluations and I
was asking oan about ideas for the
structure of the blog post pros and cons
of certain benchmarks um and even the
style of the writing and I think because
it's able to think before it gives the
final answer um it's able to connect
ideas better it can revise and uh
critique candidate ideas and and things
like that yeah I think if you need like
a know you have some short text and want
it more creative something really

[00:10]
different that that's a great use to
like give me five different ideas also
if you have just sort of like some
unstructured thoughts it's a really
brilliant thought partner so you have
like some ideas it's like well how
should I connect these things what am I
missing um and through its final answers
and through sort of reading it's like
thought process it it can really lead to
like much better results for you yeah I
use it to try out a bunch of our
internal secret ideas and it actually
tries improved yeah for Standalone
projects it's it's great like like I I I
I had to add a GitHub plugin I know
nothing about adding GitHub plugins and
I just said like hey I want GitHub
plugin that displays this and this
information about the pr and and and
like um yeah just produce the code I
just like like you know I just ask it
like okay so where do I need to paste
this code I don't even know like it's
just like yeah place it here let's go I
think for a lot of people it's uh it's
hard to really fill the AGI and until
you see the models do something better

[00:11]
than humans can at a domain that you
really care about and I think you know
for go players and chess players that
would have come you know a few years
earlier and for a lot of us that like
really value math and and coding I I
think we're starting to feel that now
our moms would be proud of
us so are there any parts of this
project anything that that really needed
to be done but you know people might not
realize how important it is so I think
building large scale reliable
infrastructure for to run our biggest
Flagship Flagship model training runs as
well as doing research experiments is
something that is not as exciting as
doing research itself but has to be done
and it's has a tremendous impact on the
success on the entire project I think
there is something special in open ey
about how we structure our research G
that we value algorithmic advancements
in the same way as building reliable
large scale systems and building data
that are needed either way for for

[00:12]
training those models I'm really proud
of openi in that way yeah I think that
has been a consistent pattern throughout
many of our big projects every time we
scale a new thing up another order of
magnitude we see another host of
problems both algorithmic and
infrastructure and we've definitely
built a capacity to to to um Advance
them both with a lot of fuckus I feel
the final model is just like literally a
beautiful piece of art right in order to
make it work you have to make sure that
every step has work right you know we
find some any Challenge and we solve it
right I think that's really how opening
ey operates and then very proud to work
out here and I also must say there's
like
a really not only brilliant people are
here but also kind hearted is just fun
to me to work over here and I'm grateful
to my colleagues to you know code with
me par code with me hang out with me eat
lunch with me like speak with the model

[00:13]
with
me so what's it like to work on the
strawberry team you can have your
brilliant ideas but most of the time you
spend on like running them and not
running and failing and and then it's
very good to have people very close by
in your office that you can ask for help
with whatever failed last time because I
mean most of the time you spend your
time debugging things that didn't work
so and having people who can help was
speaking of this U help we had many
times when we were trying to debug this
for like a week and then passing by wend
the and then like ask it and then like
he just solved it right away he started
calling it w the blessing and then
blessing people and that has been uh
really really effective and I stopped
like thinking about is this too stupid
to ask and just ask right away well one
of the things I like really appreciate
about working at open a is that from
every big project like this we like
really learn right we we we I think like

[00:14]
from daa we learn importance of
engineering from gp4 we learn importance
of research and we keep iterating like
this and uh the effect of that is that
like now the strawberry team is again
the best big uh research project team
yet because it's built on all of the
things we've learned from the previous
projects and it really like you can like
really see it working here like people
really like started developing develop
very good intuition like when do you
hack something where do you like need to
develop stronger fundamentals like when
do you st overnight where do you
actually like take a weekend off and
like come with a fresh mind to this
particular problem like I I think I
think like it's really amazing to
observe this progress we make as a
company yeah one thing I've liked is
just how organic this project has felt
the ideas have come literally from
everywhere on this team and um people
feel empowered to just like hey here's
an idea I really believe in and it's the
thing that I'm going to push and also
people are just willing to get their
hands dirty I feel like there have been

[00:15]
a lot of you know deadlines some
self-imposed but um we've all really
come together and you know been willing
to put in that work to make it happen
this project really demonstrated the
power of momentum where we get initial
good results and more and more people
get excit about particular field and
particular research they try to
contribute their new ideas those new
ideas work even better and then the
thing started snowballing and getting
more and more momentum on itself or
people just believing that this is the
right thing to do and we should continue
pushing this research
related to that I think like we have a
very like lots of very smart people but
also like very opinionated people but
people are always willing to like update
their opinions once you see results to
the contrary and I think that's like
make things really
fun it's kind of cool to be in that
place that's a combination of like a
brilliant scientists and engineers and
folks who can like build out like
incredible systems uh it's very humbling
so one thing I remember a few months ago
I remember the model was very smart but
it was also kind of boring so what was

[00:16]
it like to give the model A personality
yeah so that's interesting I remember I
asked model about the meaning of life
and it gave me an answer 42 which is not
that bad of an answer uh and you know
the kind of similarity when I asked
model you know what is love it told me
oh there like a strange human
feeling and uh once we
actually uh get gave model personality
made it actually work with chat then the
aners start being quite interesting that
day and know I asked about the love it
told me you know there's like a romantic
love familial love self love
nonconditional love conditional love and
uh it became more useful and also more
fun the funnest moment is that ask the
exact same question and you tries to
Define love with algebra
and you ask them after

[00:17]
question so what's the story of 01 mini
how did that come to be um so the
motivation is that we want to bring the
ow series to broader audience which with
like much lower cost so we created ow
mini which was designed to be like a
minimal demonstration of the whole 01
pipeline order framework um we make it
uh stand reasoning specialist which may
not necessarily know the birth dat of
our favorite celebrity but really truly
understands like how to do reasoning
effectively right and truly has a lot of
um intelligence the model is actually
really smart right it's like much
smarter than our previous best model for
all and also almost um part right with
our best model o1 uh but only comes with
like a fraction of cost and latency um
it does have the limitation that you may
not know a lot of the knowledge in the
outside world right which is not about
science or technology but we try to make

[00:18]
it roughly on par with our previous best
mini model like 40 mini and we are
working to improve it further so I'm
super excited for our external users to
just try it out for this like lightning
experience of uh reasoning and thinking
so what motivates you to do your
research I just find it fascinating that
in this world you have you have these
things that that can do intelligence and
reasoning and and they're much smaller
than you think and they can do this in
different ways it's just super
fascinating good things in life take
time and our models just tend to answer
too quickly and eventually want to have
models I can do for example research for
months or years and I feel like this is
the first step in the direction of
models I can think very long for about
one problem and now we're at the level
of minutes and I think it's just the
first step on a long path that hopefully
takes us to models that can think for
months or years as as time goes by it
feels very meaningful that uh that IE
together with a small number of people

[00:19]
can have a some substantial positive
impact on the world and also it's uh fun
day today it's just fun I like you know
speaking to the computer I like starting
a job on the cluster I very much enjoy
uh collaboration it's just
beautiful I really like our malls to be
useful and I think technology has a
chance and a promise to improve human
life and I like our models to do like
work for us to to to help us with our
our day-to-day problems and giving them
ability to reason H allows them
to do for us things that they just they
just couldn't be that that will allow us
to spend our time more productively yeah
very excited about this I mean I think
these sort of paradigms
unlock things that these the models
couldn't do before so it's not just like
answering some sets of queries a little
bit better but it's actually getting to
a point where through planning through

[00:20]
error correction it's able to just
unlock like new capabilities and you
know the ability to produce new
knowledge in the world for like science
for Discovery I think is one of the most
exciting pieces for this and I think in
some short amount of time it's going to
become like a larger and larger
contribution or contributor to its own
like development and I think that's like
a really exciting regime I think some of
the people on the team we were um math
or coding Olympiad participants in the
past and there's this huge personal
motivation to create a system that can
beat us we do best and um I think a
second thing really kind of Echoes the
point that JT and leam made you know I
do think reasoning is a much more
powerful primitive than people give it
credit for you know um when you think
about kind of accomplishing tasks
reliably really that fundamental
primitive has to be reasoning you're
you're going to hit bottlenecks and
you're going to have to navigate your
way around them so I'm really excited
for that future I I think AI researchers

[00:21]
job is to find the way to put more
compute in and Hardware people have been
doing so good of a job that the cost has
been going down exponentially for a very
long time and we don't have much time to
find another way to put in more compute
and it's kind of like a weight on my
shoulder is just getting uh larger and
larger and this new paradigm really
finds a way to unload that for probably
a long time is there anything else
you've observed as we've been going
through this project for the whole time
we've been doing it anything else that's
worth calling out I think an interesting
meta observation that that we've had is
uh every model that we train is like a
little bit different it has its own
quirks and it's almost like a artisanal
cuz when you look at a model that can do
so many different tasks um each model
you train won't be exactly the same
performance at each task so it might be
better at some tasks and worse at others
and so there's this uniqueness of like
personality to every model that is

[00:22]
almost like a little bit beautiful thank
you and congrats on releasing this
