## Before you start

Open the scanned repository in Codex with the
[Codex Security plugin](https://developers.openai.com/docs/security/plugin) installed and enabled. You'll
need a finding you've reviewed and decided to address. If you haven't run a
scan yet, start with
[Run your first security scan](https://developers.openai.com/use-cases/find-vulnerabilities-in-your-code).

## Fix the finding

1. Open and review the finding

   Open the finding from **Findings** or a completed scan in **Scans**. Read
   the affected code, the reported impact, and the evidence supporting the
   finding.

   Confirm what the fix should prevent and which legitimate behavior must
   continue to work. If the evidence is unclear, investigate the finding
   before moving to a patch.

2. Generate a focused patch

   Select the **Patch** tab, then **Generate patch**.

   Codex validates or reproduces the issue when feasible and generates a
   proposed patch. Generating the patch does not modify your selected
   checkout.

3. Review and apply the patch

   Inspect the proposed diff, including any regression tests or validation
   artifacts. Check that the change addresses the finding and preserves
   expected behavior. Resolve unrelated changes or broader refactors before
   proceeding.

   When the patch is ready, select **Apply patch**. Review the resulting
   working-tree diff.

4. Verify the fix

   Select **Verify fix**.

   Review the evidence that the original vulnerable behavior no longer
   reproduces and legitimate behavior still works. When safe and practical,
   a focused regression test should fail before the fix and pass afterward.

   If verification is incomplete, review the stated limitation and determine
   what additional testing is needed. An applied patch alone does not
   establish that the vulnerability is fixed.

5. Prepare the change for review

   Review the final diff and prepare a pull request through your normal
   development workflow. Include:
   - The finding and the behavior the patch corrects.
   - The relevant code changes.
   - The verification commands and results.
   - Any remaining uncertainty or follow-up testing.

   Verification does not automatically close the finding. Update its status
   deliberately according to your team's review and release process.

## Review the result

You should have one focused patch, evidence showing what Codex verified, and
enough context for another developer to review the change. If verification
could not establish that the fix works, keep that gap explicit.
