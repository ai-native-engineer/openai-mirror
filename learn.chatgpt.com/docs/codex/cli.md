  To get started, describe a task or try one of these commands:

  /init - create an AGENTS.md file with instructions for Codex
  /status - show current session configuration
  /permissions - choose what Codex is allowed to do
  /model - choose what model and reasoning effort to use
  /review - review any changes and find issues
```

01

## Work against your local repository

Let Codex inspect files, make edits, and run the tools already installed on your machine.

02

## Stay in control

Choose the model, reasoning effort, permissions, and commands that fit the task.

03

## Compose with scripts and CI

Use Codex interactively or call codex exec from repeatable workflows and pipelines.

Quickstart

## Get started with Codex CLI

Install Codex, sign in, and run your first task from a project directory.

1. 1 

   ### Install Codex

   macOS/LinuxWindowsnpmHomebrew

   Install the Codex CLI with the standalone installer for macOS and Linux.

   Install Codex

   ```
   curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
   ```

   Update Codex

   ```
   curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
   ```
2. 2 

   ### Run Codex and sign in

   Open a project directory and run `codex`. The first time you run Codex, choose **Sign in with ChatGPT** or another available sign-in method.

   [Review authentication options](/codex/auth)
3. 3 

   ### Start your first task

   Describe what you want to accomplish. For example, ask Codex to explain
   the project, make a focused change, or help debug an issue.

   `Tell me about this project`

   Create Git checkpoints before and after a task so you can revert changes.
   See the [best practices](/codex/learn/best-practices).

## See what Codex CLI can do

Use one focused terminal loop for interactive work, automation, review, and delegation.

01

### Keep the coding loop in your terminal

Start Codex in a repository to explore unfamiliar code, plan a change, edit files, and run your local development tools. Steer the active turn, inspect commands and diffs as they appear, and keep follow-up work in the same session.

### Use skills and plugins

Package repeatable instructions as skills, then add plugins to connect Codex to your team's tools and data without leaving the CLI.

### Review changes before they ship

Run a dedicated review against uncommitted changes, a commit, or a base branch. Codex reports prioritized findings without modifying your working tree, so you can address risks before you commit or open a pull request.

## Build a terminal workflow around Codex

Learn about the CLI features you can use to resume sessions, add visual
and web context, split up complex work, and connect Codex to your
development tools.

[01   `codex resume`

### Return to a saved chat

Reopen a recent chat from the current repository, or search across local chats when you need to return to older work.](/codex/developer-commands?surface=cli#codex-resume)[02   `codex --image`

### Bring visual context into the prompt

Pass an error screenshot, architecture diagram, or design reference with the first prompt, or paste an image into the interactive composer.](/codex/image-inputs?surface=cli)[03   `subagents`

### Split up a larger investigation

Ask Codex to delegate focused work to specialized agents, then bring their findings back into the main terminal session.](/codex/agent-configuration/subagents)[04   `codex --search`

### Search for current context

Switch a run to live web search when a task depends on current releases, documentation, or external behavior. Search activity stays visible in the transcript.](/codex/web-search?surface=cli)[05   `codex cloud`

### Move work to Codex cloud

Browse active and completed chats, submit work to a configured environment, and apply the result to your local repository from the terminal.](/codex/cloud#use-codex-cloud-from-the-cli)[06   `codex mcp`

### Connect external tools with MCP

Add local or remote MCP servers, authenticate when needed, and inspect the tools available to the current session before Codex uses them.](/codex/extend/mcp?surface=cli)[07   `/permissions`

### Set the boundaries for each run

Choose when Codex can edit files or run commands without asking, and inspect the active sandbox and writable roots before you continue.](/codex/agent-approvals-security)[08   `codex completion`

### Fit Codex to your terminal

Generate completions for your shell, choose a syntax theme, and open longer prompts in the editor configured by VISUAL or EDITOR.](/codex/cli-customization)

## Use Codex CLI when…

### You work from the terminal

Explore, edit, and run a repository in one focused loop.

### You need scripting or CI

Run a non-interactive command in a repeatable workflow.

### You want a local code review

Inspect changes before you commit or open a pull request.

### You want to hand work to the cloud

Launch a cloud chat and return to the terminal later.
