# ChatGPT Business - Release Notes

A changelog of the latest updates for ChatGPT Business plan

Updated: 6 hours ago

# **June 25, 2026**

## **Memory improvements for ChatGPT Business**

We’re rolling out improved memory for ChatGPT Business. When memory is enabled, ChatGPT can use relevant context from past chats to keep memory current and make responses more relevant as work changes, rather than relying only on details saved manually.  
  
Users can now:

* Review a memory summary showing information ChatGPT may use to personalize responses.
* View Sources below personalized responses to see relevant context from memories, past chats, and custom instructions.
* Correct memory, delete a referenced chat, mark a source as not relevant, turn memory off, or return to legacy Saved memories.

The memory summary is a high-level view of relevant context and may not include everything ChatGPT can remember or reference.  
  
This update does not affect Codex memory. Project-only memory remains contained within each project and does not use memories or conversations from outside that project. These improvements are available at no additional cost.  
  
Learn more about the [research](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-memory-dreaming/) behind these memory improvements in ChatGPT.

## **Codex Remote GA and DigitalOcean plugin**

Codex Remote is now generally available to users in ChatGPT Business workspaces. From the ChatGPT mobile app, users can start or continue work on a connected Mac or Windows host, review progress, and approve actions from their phone. Remote Control now uses authenticated one-to-one QR pairing between each supported mobile device and each host. Connections used since June 8 remain paired; older inactive connections need to pair again. Signing out turns off Remote Control without removing existing pairings.  
  
The new [DigitalOcean Droplet Workspace plugin](https://chatgpt.com/plugins/share/5dc672c7116c44ff92595d48e72df522) is also available to ChatGPT Business users. It lets Codex provision a DigitalOcean Droplet, configure SSH access, and connect it to the Codex app as a remote workspace. Users should update the ChatGPT mobile app and Codex app to the latest versions before connecting. [Learn more about using Codex with a ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/articles/11369540).

# June 19, 2026

## Slack connector actions and OAuth scope approvals

ChatGPT Business workspaces can now use Slack connector actions in ChatGPT when the Slack app is connected and actions are enabled. In addition to searching Slack, users can ask ChatGPT to help take supported Slack actions such as joining a channel, creating a reminder, uploading a file, or updating their Slack profile.  
  
Workspace owners and admins can manage Slack in Apps in ChatGPT, including Action control. Some actions may require additional Slack OAuth scopes or Slack admin approval. If a user tries an action that needs scopes their workspace has not approved, ChatGPT may ask them to reconnect Slack or contact an admin. Learn more in the [ChatGPT Slack app article](https://help.openai.com/articles/12525822).

# June 18, 2026

## Record & Replay in Codex

Record & Replay is a new Codex app feature for macOS that lets eligible Business users demonstrate a workflow once and turn it into a reusable skill. It can help teams capture stable, repeatable workflows that are easier to show than describe, then reuse them with Codex, Computer Use, browser actions, plugins, or a combination of available tools.  
  
Record & Replay requires Computer Use to be available and enabled, and initial availability excludes the European Union, UK and Switzerland. Users should keep recordings focused on the workflow and avoid secrets or sensitive data. Learn more in the [Record & Replay guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/record-and-replay).

# **June 11, 2026**

## **Codex updates**

We’ve made several Codex updates, including:

* Eligible Business users can send Codex invitations from the profile menu by choosing **Invite a coworker**, and receive a referral bonus when the recipient joins the workspace and sends their first Codex message. Learn more in [Invite friends and coworkers](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing#invite-friends-and-coworkers) and review the [current terms](/en/articles/20001271). Admins and owners can use the toggle in **Workspace settings > Permissions & Roles** to control this feature.
* We added [Developer mode](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/browser#developer-mode) for Browser use in Chrome and the Codex in-app browser, where available. Developer mode lets Codex use controlled Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) access for performance profiling and deeper debugging of network traffic, console output, runtime errors, DOM state, and applied styles. The feature is turned off by default at the user level, and can be enabled from Codex app settings. Admins and owners can turn off the feature from [Codex cloud settings](https://chatgpt.com/codex/cloud/settings/) by accessing the **Policies & Configurations** pane. [Learn more](/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan#in-app-browser-developer-mode).

The release also adds /init in the app composer for generating an AGENTS.md scaffold, support for configuring per-app access controls for Computer Use on Windows, clearer usage-limit errors with workspace guidance and reset timing when available, and a new **Unread chats** section in the command menu. [Learn more](https://developers.openai.com/codex/changelog)

# June 2, 2026

## Build and deploy internal websites and apps with ChatGPT Sites

ChatGPT Sites is now available in preview for ChatGPT Business workspaces with Codex access. Available as a plugin, teams can ask Codex to create, iterate on, and deploy lightweight full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript web apps for internal workspace use, with hosted site URLs, Sign in with ChatGPT access and  data & file storage storage, while keeping access workspace internal.   
  
Admins and owners can manage enablement and access through workspace settings and RBAC. For Business workspaces, ChatGPT Sites is enabled by default, and can be managed from **Workspace settings > Permissions & Roles.** Admins and owners can disable created sites from **Workspace settings > Sites.**   
  
Learn more: [Codex Sites developer guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/sites).

## Role-specific plugins in Codex

Role-specific plugins are rolling out in Codex for supported ChatGPT Business workspaces. This first set includes Sales, Data Analytics, Product Design, Creative Production, Investment Banking, and Public Equity Investing. These plugins package role-specific skills, app integrations, starter prompts, and workflow guidance so teams can use Codex for sales prep, analytics and dashboards, prototypes, creative assets, and financial research.  
  
This launch also adds 66 single-app plugins that expand the integrations available in Codex, including tools such as Databricks, Salesforce, Hex, and Clay. Users can add available plugins from the Codex plugin directory, and Codex can help them complete setup. Workspace admins control the underlying app permissions in workspace settings; if a required app is not enabled, the related plugin may not be available.  
  
Learn more: [Plugins in Codex](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001256).

## Active account session controls

We’re rolling out **Active sessions**, a new security feature in ChatGPT that helps users review sessions associated with their account and sign out of sessions they don’t recognize.  
  
  
**Availability:** This feature is not available for accounts linked to an organization’s SSO sign-in, including SAML or OIDC. This can apply even if the organization does not require SSO for every sign-in, or if the user signed in another way for their current session.  
  
Users with access can now:

* Review first-party OpenAI sessions from **Settings** > **Security** > **Active sessions**, with available details such as device, app, approximate location, sign-in time, trusted-device status, and whether it is the current session.
* Log out of individual sessions or all sessions from **Active sessions**

Active sessions shows sessions known through session management, including ChatGPT, Codex, and API Platform sessions where available. It does not manage third-party app sessions, connected apps, Sign in with ChatGPT sessions used only for third-party services, or Codex CLI sessions.

# May 29, 2026

## Codex updates: Computer use and remote control for Windows, usage profiles

Codex now supports Computer Use on Windows in the Codex app. Business users with Codex access can use Computer Use to let Codex see, click, and type in Windows applications. Users can also continue Windows workflows from ChatGPT on iOS or Android, or from Codex on Mac, to check progress, respond to prompts, and steer while away from the desk while the Windows machine remains the host for project files, shell, app server, and local context.  
  
To try Computer Use on Windows, install the Computer Use plugin from the Plugins marketplace and invoke it using the @ mention, or Codex can use it when appropriate for the task.  
  
This release also improves Codex app responsiveness and in-app browser speed, stability, and web compatibility, and adds gradually rolling out Codex profiles for eligible users. Profiles let users review and track their Codex identity, activity over time, profile details, usage stats, and token activity.  
  
Computer Use on Windows is unavailable in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland at launch.  
  
Learn more: [Computer Use](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/computer-use), [Remote control](https://developers.openai.com/codex/remote-connections), [Profiles](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/settings#profile).

# May 28, 2026

## App templates for GitHub Enterprise, Snowflake, and Databricks

Workspace admins and owners on Business plans can now use ChatGPT app templates to create workspace-specific apps for GitHub Enterprise, Snowflake, and Databricks. App templates provide a guided setup flow for provider-specific configuration such as OAuth credentials, callback URLs, webhook details, managed MCP server URLs, and workspace access controls before admins publish the app to members.  
  
Use the new setup guides to understand the general app-template flow and the provider-specific steps for each template: [ChatGPT app templates](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001247), [GitHub Enterprise app template](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001248), [Snowflake app template](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001249), and [Databricks app template](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001250).  
  
After publishing, admins can manage the resulting app from Workspace settings > Apps > Enabled, including role access, action controls, and action confirmation.

## New controls and capabilities for ChatGPT workspace agents

We’re rolling out new model, app access, and response capabilities for workspace agents in ChatGPT Business.  
  
Workspace agents now support:

* GPT-5.5 and reasoning effort controls: When building an agent, creators can choose GPT-5.5 and set the reasoning effort the agent uses. We’ve also improved response speed across agents.
* Guided agent setup: ChatGPT now asks setup questions to help users create useful agents more quickly.
* Speech output: Agents can now create audio files as part of their responses.
* Smarter Slack thread replies: Agents used in Slack can respond to relevant follow-up messages in a thread after the initial mention. Creators can choose whether an agent responds to relevant thread messages or only when it is mentioned.

# May 21, 2026

## Codex updates: richer context, shared plugins, goal mode, browser improvements, remote locked use, and analytics

Codex now gives teams more ways to bring context into longer workflows, reuse internal tools, and track adoption:

* [Appshots](https://developers.openai.com/codex/appshots) in the macOS app let users attach an app window to a Codex thread with a hotkey, including a screenshot and available text.
* [Goal mode](https://developers.openai.com/codex/prompting#goal-mode) is generally available across the Codex app, IDE extension, and CLI, so users can define an outcome and success criteria and let Codex keep working toward it.
* [In-app browser annotations](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/browser#styling-feedback) support more precise styling feedback for browser-based and frontend work.
* [Locked computer use](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/computer-use#locked-use) lets users keep Codex working remotely and securely after the Mac locks, subject to existing regional constraints. Admins and owners can turn this feature off by setting `remote_computer_use = false` in the [Policies & Configurations](https://chatgpt.com/codex/cloud/settings/policies) setting in Codex cloud. Review [configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference#requirementstoml) for more details.
* [Browser-use improvements](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/browser) add advanced annotation mode, faster asset extraction, read-only JavaScript context, tab grouping usability, less Chrome extension tab clutter, and reliability improvements.
* [Plugin sharing](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build#share-a-local-plugin-with-your-workspace) lets ChatGPT Business users share locally built plugins with workspace members from the Codex app so teams can reuse internal tools and workflows. Shared plugins stay within the workspace and organization boundary, appear under Shared with you, and can be disabled by admins and owners with `plugin_sharing = false` in the [Policies & Configurations](https://chatgpt.com/codex/cloud/settings/policies) setting in Codex cloud. Review [configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference#requirementstoml) for more details.
* The [global admin console](/en/articles/12289294-global-admin-console#analytics) now includes Codex analytics, with active users, credits and tokens, threads and turns, user leaderboards, plugin usage, accepted lines of code, model usage, and a console-aligned UI.

## Workspace agents are now generally available in ChatGPT Business, Enterprise, and Edu.

Workspace agents help teams get more done together across tools. They can own entire workflows on their own, follow team processes, and be shared across your team so people can build once and use together.We’ve also added new admin controls and visibility:

* Agent builders can set safeguards on which actions agents can take for each app enabled in their workspace.
* Admins can view workspace agent activity and usage in the [admin console](https://admin.openai.com/).

We’ve extended the free period for workspace agents until July 6, 2026. Credit-based pricing will begin on that date.

# May 14, 2026

## Codex remote access and access tokens for automation

Teams can now use the ChatGPT mobile app to stay connected to Codex work running on a host Mac, making it easier to answer questions, redirect work, approve actions, review outputs, and keep longer-running tasks moving when away from the host machine. The mobile experience reflects the live state of the connected environment, including project context, approvals, screenshots, terminal output, diffs, and test results.  
  
Codex also adds access tokens for trusted, non-interactive local workflows, so approved automation can run through scripts, schedulers, or private CI runners with a ChatGPT workspace identity.  
  
Codex in the ChatGPT mobile app is rolling out in preview on iOS and Android across all plans, including Business, in supported regions. To try it, update both the ChatGPT mobile app and the Codex app on macOS. Mobile setup begins in the Codex App on the host and may require Remote Control access to be enabled for the workspace.

Learn more in [Remote connections](https://developers.openai.com/codex/remote-connections) and [Access tokens](https://developers.openai.com/codex/enterprise/access-tokens).

# May 6, 2026

## Analytics and Agents in the global admin console

The global admin console now includes new Analytics and Agents areas. Analytics gives admins a consolidated view of adoption and usage, with trend views for active users and message activity plus drilldowns for GPTs, projects, skills, users, tool interactions, connector interactions, and workspace health.  
  
Agents gives admins a consolidated view of workspace agents across the organization. Admins can open an agent to review details such as Agent ID, recent activity, connected apps, memory files, schedules, and agent analytics such as unique users and runs over time, or move into Builder to edit it. Workspace Owners can access these views from the global admin console. [Learn more](/en/articles/12289294-global-admin-console).

# May 5, 2026

## ChatGPT for Excel and Google Sheets

ChatGPT for Excel and Google Sheets is now available globally for ChatGPT Business, giving teams a spreadsheet-native ChatGPT sidebar in Excel and Google Sheets for building, cleaning up, updating, and explaining workbooks. It supports Skills and apps where available, so spreadsheet work can use approved files, systems, and data sources from a user’s ChatGPT account.  
  
Business customers have a free preview through June 2, 2026; after that, usage follows plan credits and usage terms. Admins can enable ChatGPT for Excel and Sheets in workspace settings and enable apps in the admin portal; app availability may depend on entitlements, admin settings, and source permissions. [Learn more](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001063).

# April 22, 2026

## **ChatGPT Workspace Agents for Enterprise and Business**

ChatGPT workspace agents are rolling out gradually over the next few weeks to ChatGPT Business workspaces.  
  
Workspace Agents let organizations build and use agents for repeatable tasks and automate business workflows leveraging all your connected apps & can run in ChatGPT and/or Slack. Workspace agents can be created, previewed before publishing, shared within a workspace, and run on a schedule.  
  
Eligible workspaces can now:

* Create agents from templates or build from scratch.
* Connect agents to tools and apps such as Google Drive, Google Calendar, Slack, and SharePoint.
* Add skills, files, and custom MCP servers.
* Share agents privately, by link, or in the workspace directory.

Previously, in Japan, data residency for apps with sync was limited to Google Drive and GitHub. This launch extends Japan data residency support to all sync connectors. Learn more about [data residency](/en/articles/9903489-data-residency-and-inference-residency-for-chatgpt).

# April 20, 2026

## Simplified app action controls

Workspace owners and admins can now manage app actions with a simplified model in **Workspace settings > Apps**. In **Action control**, admins can choose whether an app allows all actions, allows only read actions, or uses a custom configuration for current actions.  
  
Admins can also choose how actions added later are handled by enabling all new actions, enabling only new read actions, or disabling new actions until they are reviewed. This makes it easier to manage app permissions while keeping granular control when needed.  
  
Owners and admins may want to review currently enabled apps, RBAC access, and app action settings to confirm that each app's policy matches their workspace needs. For more information, see: [Admin Controls, Security, and Compliance in apps (Enterprise, Edu, and Business)](https://help.openai.com/articles/11509118)

# **April 16, 2026**

* **Search and filtering:** Quickly find specific members and review individual usage patterns.

# April 8, 2026

## Outlook shared mailbox and shared calendar actions

The Outlook Email and Calendar apps for ChatGPT now support more delegated Outlook workflows for teams. With the right Microsoft permissions, users can ask ChatGPT to list and read shared mailbox messages, browse shared mailbox folders, mark shared mail read or unread, move shared messages, and send plain-text email from or on behalf of a shared mailbox. ChatGPT can also create, update, respond to, cancel, delete, and attach small files to events on shared Outlook calendars.

Workspace owners and admins should review the Outlook app's action controls before enabling newly added actions. Users who previously connected Outlook may need to reconnect after the workspace enables the new actions; Microsoft Entra approval may also be required. [Learn more](/en/articles/12512241).

# April 2, 2026

## New Codex seats in ChatGPT Business

We're introducing a new seat type: a Codex seat based on flexible, credit based pricing. Codex seats have no fixed cost per month, and provide access to Codex only - they do not include ChatGPT workspace access. There's no minimum number of Codex seats you need to purchase, but because seats are billed on usage, using Codex requires [workspace credits](/en/articles/20001106-codex-rate-card).  
  
Read about [Codex seats](/en/articles/8792828-what-is-chatgpt-business#codex-seats-usage-based-no-fixed-cost), how to [add or change](/en/articles/8542216-managing-members-seat-types-and-roles-in-chatgpt-business#invite-members) them, and [billing implications](/en/articles/8792536-managing-billing-and-seats-in-chatgpt-business#billing-for-codex-seats-and-credits). If you’re new to ChatGPT Business, get started with [What is ChatGPT Business?](/en/articles/8792828)  
  
For a limited time, eligible ChatGPT Business workspaces can earn up to $100 in Codex credits per newly added Codex seat after that member sends their first Codex message, up to $500 per workspace. Learn more in [Codex for Business promotion: earn up to $500 in credits](/en/articles/20001150-codex-for-teams-promotion-earn-up-to-500-in-credits).  
  
Along with this change, we're reducing the price of subscription-based ChatGPT seats by USD $5 / month (actual reduction may depend on pricing in your region).  
  
If you're a current subscriber, the new, lower price will be reflected in your next monthly or annual bill. We're refunding the pro-rated price difference on your current bill as a credit that can be applied to your next subscription renewal to account for the price change. Learn more [here](/en/articles/8792536-managing-billing-and-seats-in-chatgpt-business#refunds-and-cancellations).  
  
Lastly, we've updated the Codex Rate Card to align with token-based usage pricing. This may result in a difference in what you're charged. Read more in the [Codex rate card](/en/articles/20001106-codex-rate-card). ChatGPT rates remain unchanged.

# March 27, 2026

## Updated Box, Notion, Linear, and Dropbox apps

We’re rolling out updated [Box](/en/articles/12368225-box-app-with-sync), [Notion](/en/articles/12532955-notion-app-with-sync), [Linear](/en/articles/12526595-linear-app-with-sync), and [Dropbox](/en/articles/12364275-dropbox-app-with-sync) apps in ChatGPT Business. These updates add new app actions, including new write capabilities where supported, and bring the latest app experience into ChatGPT.

These apps are enabled automatically, and workspace admins/owners can review app actions in **Workspace settings > Apps** to enable those aligned to their workspace needs. Additionally, new actions may involve updated scopes - admins/owners should check the [Box](/en/articles/12368225-box-app-with-sync), [Notion](/en/articles/12532955-notion-app-with-sync), [Linear](/en/articles/12526595-linear-app-with-sync), and [Dropbox](/en/articles/12364275-dropbox-app-with-sync) app pages for details, and authorize any new scopes required to support new actions (such as write actions). New users may not be able to connect these apps until the scope authorizations are met, or actions are enabled/disabled in alignment with authorized scopes.

Members who previously connected these apps may need to reconnect the app after admin review to start using the updated experience.

# March 26, 2026

## Plugins in Codex

Codex now includes a curated plugins directory that lets users discover, install, and use packaged workflows built from apps and skills directly in Codex. Plugins are installable bundles for reusable Codex workflows, making it easier to share the same setup across projects or teams. Plugins can package skills, optional app integrations, and MCP server configurations in a single place. [Learn more](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins).

Plugin availability follows workspace app controls, so if the underlying app is disabled, the matching plugin can also be unavailable. Workspace owners can manage app access in Workspace settings → Apps.

# **March 25, 2026**

## **Google Drive app unification**

Google’s file apps in ChatGPT are now unified under Google Drive, providing a single app experience for interacting with your Google Docs, Sheets and Slides on Google Drive.  
  
The new Google Drive actions are on by default for Business workspaces. Admins/owners can review and manage actions from **Workspace settings > Apps.** Locate the Google Drive entry and click **Manage actions**.  
  
Existing users of Google Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides apps are unaffected - previously connected apps continue to work. To take advantage of the unified experience, existing users can disconnect and reconnect the Google Drive app to start using the new actions within ChatGPT. New users can connect to the Google Drive app to use Docs, Sheets and Slides actions, without needing to connect the separate apps.  
  
Google Workspace admins may need to re-authorize Google scopes corresponding to app actions - otherwise, users may hit connection errors when trying to connect. [Read more.](/en/articles/10408842-google-app-for-chatgpt-data-controls-faq)

# March 19, 2026

## Legacy deep research mode deprecation notice

The legacy deep research mode will be removed on Thursday, March 26, 2026. This change only affects the legacy mode; the current deep research experience will remain unchanged.  
  
Historical conversations and results will remain accessible.  
  
To learn more about deep research, see: [Deep research in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/articles/10500283).

# **March 13, 2026**

## **Write actions for Microsoft and Google apps in ChatGPT**

We've updated scopes and actions in Google and Microsoft apps in ChatGPT to include support for write actions. You can now use apps like Microsoft Outlook email to draft emails for you, Google docs and sheets to create spreadsheets or docs, or setup meetings using the respective calendar apps.

Write actions remain disabled by default until workspace admins enable them in **Workspace settings > Apps > Manage actions** for each app. For Microsoft apps, some customers may also need Microsoft Entra admin approval for updated scopes before new users can connect successfully. Learn more in the Help Center: [Apps in ChatGPT](/en/articles/11487775), [Google App for ChatGPT - Data Controls FAQ](/en/articles/10408842-google-app-for-chatgpt-data-controls-faq), [Outlook Email and Calendar app for ChatGPT](/en/articles/12512241-outlook-email-and-calendar-app-for-chatgpt), and [Microsoft Teams app for ChatGPT](/en/articles/12552368-microsoft-teams-app-for-chatgpt).

# **March 11, 2026**

## **Updated scopes for Microsoft apps**

We updated the scopes requested by the [Outlook Calendar](/en/articles/12512241), [Outlook Email](/en/articles/12512241), [Microsoft SharePoint](/en/articles/12143177) and [Microsoft Teams](/en/articles/12552368) apps to support additional actions. Microsoft Entra admins will need to review and approve the updated app scopes before new users connect - users may hit connection issues, otherwise.

Note that the new scopes do not automatically make available (or enable) new actions for these apps (including any write actions). Workspace admins and owners will need to review available app actions by locating the app entry in **Workspace settings > Apps**, and then clicking **Manage actions**.

New actions, when made available, are disabled by default - admins/owners can review and then enable actions if appropriate for their workspace.

# **March 4, 2026**

## **Codex app on Windows**

Codex app is now available on Windows for ChatGPT Business workspaces that include Codex. It gives members a Windows desktop surface for running multiple Codex agents in parallel, with isolated worktrees, reviewable diffs, and interoperability with Codex in the CLI and IDE.

Members can sign in with ChatGPT from the app to start work from a Windows environment, and admins do not need to configure a separate app-specific permission model. The app uses the same workspace controls as other Codex surfaces. Learn more: [Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan](/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan).

# **February 25, 2026**

## **Add sources to your projects from anywhere**

Projects now make it easy to build a living knowledge base by adding sources wherever your context already lives; from apps, conversations, or quick text inputs.

* **Sources from apps:** Paste a link to a Slack channel or Google Drive file or folder to add it directly as a project source.

  + Additionally, use connected apps directly in chats.
* **Sources from chats:** Save useful ChatGPT responses into your project so great outputs become reusable knowledge.
* **Ad-hoc text sources:** Paste notes, briefs, or reference material directly to capture context instantly.

# February 2, 2026

## Introducing the Codex App

Today we’re releasing the Codex app for MacOS,  a command center for managing multiple coding agents in parallel. The app lets you run long‑horizon and background tasks, review clean diffs from isolated worktrees, see agent progress and decisions, and execute reusable skills and automations.

The Codex app follows the same admin controls as Codex local and Codex cloud. Codex local must be enabled for members to use the Codex app. Admins/owners can control Codex access from [Workspace settings](https://chatgpt.com/admin/permissions) -> Permissions & roles.

We’re also introducing a limited time promotion - Business users receive 2x Codex rate limits. Get started by [downloading](https://chatgpt.com/codex) the macOS app, and [learn more](/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan) about Codex.

# December 18, 2025

## Introducing the app directory in ChatGPT

You can now browse and add approved apps in the new [**app directory**](https://chatgpt.com/apps). Apps let you work with your tools and data directly inside a conversation—from interactive in-chat experiences to secure connections that allow ChatGPT to search and reference information from third-party services.  
  
As part of this update, [**connectors now appear in the directory as apps**](/en/articles/11487775-apps-in-chatgpt), making it easier to manage all your tools in one place. References across the Help Center have been updated to reflect this new terminology.  
  
For ChatGPT Business users, apps are enabled by default. Admins and owners can control which apps are available for their workspace and set which actions each app is allowed to take through [workspace settings](https://chatgpt.com/admin/ca).   
  
Apps are available to all logged-in ChatGPT users, with availability and functionality varying by plan and region. Some apps or capabilities may not be available in certain regions (including the EEA, GB, or Switzerland) or may require specific plan tiers.  
  
Starting today, [developers can submit apps for review and publication](https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/) in the app directory, making approved apps available to a broader set of ChatGPT users.

## Introducing the ChatGPT app and ChatGPT connector for Slack

We’re rolling out two new ways to bring Slack and ChatGPT together: a [connector](/en/articles/11487775-connectors-in-chatgpt) that brings your Slack context into ChatGPT, and a ChatGPT app for Slack – an integration that enables you to chat with ChatGPT from inside Slack.

With the[**ChatGPT app for Slack,**](https://intercom.help/openai/en/articles/12462158-chatgpt-app-for-slack) you can chat one-on-one with ChatGPT in a dedicated Slack sidebar – a space to ask questions, summarize long threads into action items, draft replies, and search messages and files you already have access to. Chats you start in Slack also appear in your ChatGPT sidebar, so it’s easy to pick up later from web or mobile. Semantic search is supported for Slack customers with AI enabled on Business+ or Enterprise+ plans; all other plans use keyword search.

With the [**ChatGPT connector for Slack**](https://intercom.help/openai/en/articles/12525822-chatgpt-connector-for-slack)**,** you can securely bring in context from your Slack channels and DMs, making responses more helpful Available in chat, Deep Research, and Agent Mode. The connector is enabled by default for Business customers, and users can enable from **Settings > Apps & Connectors**.

Both app and connector are available to **Plus, Pro, Business and Enterprise/Edu** customers. Additionally, the ChatGPT app for Slack requires a **paid Slack account;** availability and workspace installation may depend on your Slack workspace settings.

Installing the app requires the connector to be enabled for your account.

Visit the [**ChatGPT app for Slack**](https://intercom.help/openai/en/articles/12462158-chatgpt-app-for-slack)page to get started with installation.

We additionally added the [Intercom synced connector](/en/articles/12562556-intercom-synced-connector), which allows you access and interact with your Intercom data—including conversations, tickets, and help center content.

## Introducing project sharing

Today, we’re announcing an update to [projects in ChatGPT](/en/articles/10169521-projects-in-chatgpt). Now you can share projects with teammates in your workspace, adding files and instructions together to guide ChatGPT’s responses toward a shared goal. Members can chat with the project’s context to stay on the same page as new information gets added and create work that stays consistent in tone.

Shared projects are ideal for ongoing work like client management, content creation, reporting, and research.

Invite members in your workspace by individual email, group email, or shared link. Add/remove project members, set project access permissions, create new chats, add/remove files, and allow members to bring existing chats into the project. Memory is project-only, ensuring sensitive data stays safely within the project.

# August 27, 2025

## Updates to Codex

Starting today, Codex works with you everywhere you build—in your terminal or IDE, on the web, in GitHub, and even from the ChatGPT iOS app. Your ChatGPT account connects it all, so you can work seamlessly between your local environment and Codex’s cloud without losing state.

We’re excited to introduce the latest Codex updates:

* **IDE Extension:** The new extension brings codex into VS Code, Cursor, and other VS Code forks, so that you can seamlessly preview local changes and edit code

## Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts Connectors in ChatGPT

Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts are now available to connect and use in chat. Once you enable them, ChatGPT will automatically reference them when relevant, making it faster and easier to bring information from these tools into your conversations without having to manually select them each time.

If you already have Gmail or Google Calendar enabled for deep research, you can now also use them in chat. To use them in deep research, you will still need to enable each connector separately and select it every time you start a new deep research request.

Learn more about [**connectors**](/en/articles/11487775-connectors-in-chatgpt).

# August 22, 2025

## Project-only memory

An improvement to [projects](/en/articles/10169521-projects-in-chatgpt) is now available. When creating a project, users have the option to enable **project-only memory.**

With **project-only memory** enabled, ChatGPT can use other conversations in that project for additional context, and won’t use your [saved memories](/en/articles/11146739-how-does-reference-saved-memories-work) from outside the project to shape responses. Additionally, it won’t carry anything from the project into future chats outside of the project.

This creates a focused, self-contained space, which is useful for long-running or sensitive work where you want ChatGPT to stay anchored to that project’s tone, context, and history.

Note:

* **Personal Memory** must be enabled to utilize this feature.

  + **Settings** -> **Personalization** -> **Memory**
* **Workspace Memory must be enabled to utilize this feature.**

  + Workspace owners can enable this by **Workspace Settings** -> **Memory**
* This feature will initially only be available on the ChatGPT website and Windows app. Support for mobile (iOS and Android) and macOS app will follow in the coming weeks.

GPT-5 in ChatGPT is our next flagship model and the new default for all logged-in users. It simplifies ChatGPT to a single auto-switching system that brings together the best of our previous models into a **smart, fast model.**

GPT-5 is available to all ChatGPT Tiers. Users on Paid tiers - Plus, Pro, and Team - have access to the model picker, which enables you to manually select GPT-5 or GPT-5 Thinking. Pro and Team tier users have access to GPT-5 Thinking Pro, which takes a bit longer to think but delivers the accuracy you need for complex tasks.

[Learn more about GPT-5 in ChatGPT.](/en/articles/11909943)

## Legacy models

We will enable Team users to continue to access legacy mode - [learn more](https://Legacy%20Model%20Access%20for%20Team,%20Enterprise,%20and%20Edu%20Users).

* GPT-4o
* GPT-4.1
* GPT-4.5
* GPT-4.1-mini
* o4-mini
* o4-mini-high
* o3
* o3-pro

ChatGPT will automatically switch it to the closest GPT-5 equivalent. Chats with 4o, 4.1, 4.5, 4.1-mini, o4-mini, or o4-mini-high will open in GPT-5, chats with o3 will open in GPT-5-Thinking, and chats with o3-Pro will open in GPT-5-Pro (available only on Pro and Team).

Please note that Voice mode is still powered by GPT-4o.

## Personalities

You can now choose from four distinct personalities or use the Default personality in your  [Customize ChatGPT settings](https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Personalization). Default is the standard ChatGPT style: clear, neutral, and adaptable. The other personalities each have their own style and tone, described below.

**Cynic** – Sarcastic and dry, delivers blunt help with wit. Often teases, but provides direct, practical answers when it matters.

**Robot** – Precise, efficient, and emotionless, delivering direct answers without extra words.

**Listener** – Warm and laid-back, reflecting your thoughts back with calm clarity and light wit.

**Nerd** – Playful and curious, explaining concepts clearly while celebrating knowledge and discovery.

Please note that these personalities will not apply to Voice mode.

## Accent Colors

You can now set an accent color that applies to elements in ChatGPT, including your conversation bubbles, the Voice button, and highlighted text.

**On web:** Click your profile icon at the bottom left, select **Settings**, go to the **General** tab, and choose an option from the **Accent color** drop-down.

**On mobile (iOS and Android):** Tap your profile icon at the bottom, go to **Personalization**, then select **Color Scheme** to pick your accent color.

## ChatGPT Voice updates

Today we’re rolling out improvements to Voice Mode to make it more accessible and useful for everyone. It also now works with custom GPTs. We’re expanding access with near-unlimited use for Plus users and hours each day for Free users. To simplify the experience, Standard Voice Mode will be retired in 30 days, unifying all users onto our latest voice experience.

For paid users, Voice now adapts to your instructions, adjusting its speaking style (length, speed, tone, and more) to fit the moment.

# July 29, 2025

## Study Mode

Study mode is currently available to users in Free, Plus, Pro, and Teams plans globally and will expand to Edu plans in the coming weeks. Study mode works with any model available in ChatGPT on iOS, Android, web, and desktop.

Study mode is a new learning experience in ChatGPT designed to help you build a deeper understanding of any topic. When you turn it on, ChatGPT will ask interactive questions to understand your goals and skill level, then work with you to reach the answer together.

With Study mode enabled, ChatGPT can:

* Guide understanding with Socratic-style questions.
* Break concepts into easy to follow sections starting simple and adding complexity as you progress.
* Personalize responses based on your past chats if memory is on, using examples and tips tailored to you.
* Check your understanding with open-ended prompts and feedback.
* Work with your materials by referencing images or PDFs you upload.

You can enable study mode at any time by selecting **Tools** in the prompt window and choosing **Study and learn** from the drop‑down menu or go to [chatgpt.com/studymode](http://chatgpt.com/studymode).

Study mode is powered by custom system instructions and can have some inconsistent behavior and mistakes across conversations. We plan on training this behavior directly into our main models once we’ve learned what works best through iteration and user feedback.

## Use ChatGPT alongside your team

We’re launching a new ChatGPT plan for teams of all sizes, which provides a secure, collaborative workspace to get the most out of ChatGPT at work.

ChatGPT Team offers access to our advanced models like GPT-4 and DALL·E 3, and tools like Advanced Data Analysis. It additionally includes a dedicated collaborative workspace for your team and admin tools for team management. As with ChatGPT Enterprise, you own and control your business data — we do not train on your business data or conversations, and our models don’t learn from your usage. More details on our data privacy practices can be found on our privacy page and Trust Portal.
