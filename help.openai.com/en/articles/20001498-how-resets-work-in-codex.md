# How resets work in Codex

Learn how banked resets work, how to use them, when they expire, and how to troubleshoot reset issues.

Updated: 10 days ago

# Types of Codex resets

* **OpenAI-granted banked reset:** A free, one-time reset saved to your account for later use, including resets earned through qualifying referral promotions. Receiving one does not refresh your usage; you choose when to use it before it expires.
* **OpenAI-granted automatic reset (sometimes called a global reset):** A free reset applied directly to the accounts and usage limits selected for an offer. You do not need to redeem it, and it is not saved in your banked balance. “Global” does not mean every account or every usage limit.
* **Purchased reset (paid instant reset):** A reset you buy for immediate use, rather than saving it for later. Paid resets are offered to selected Plus and Pro personal accounts; having one of those plans does not guarantee access. See: [Paid weekly Work and Codex rate limit resets](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001507) for purchase details.

These one-time resets are separate from your regular scheduled usage refresh. They do not permanently increase your plan’s limits or add usage credits. Free banked and automatic resets are discretionary promotional benefits, with no guaranteed availability or schedule.

# Find and use a banked reset

1. In the desktop app, open **Settings > Usage & billing**. On the web, open **Usage settings**. This option is not available in the mobile app.
2. Select the usage summary showing an available reset, such as “**1 reset available**” or “**Full reset**.”
3. Review the usage limits it covers and its expiration, then confirm that you want to use it.

In Codex CLI, enter /usage and select **Redeem reset**. If your CLI version does not show this option, use the desktop app or web.

On desktop, **Use reset** redeems a reset saved in **Available**, while **Buy an instant reset** opens a separate paid offer. Completing a paid purchase does not use your banked balance.

To use a banked reset from **Usage settings**, at least one allowance it covers must have less than 80% remaining. If all covered allowances have 80% or more remaining, you’ll see “Your usage does not need a reset right now,” and the reset stays available until you use it or it expires.

You can also ask Codex to use a banked reset by enabling **Allow your assistant to use resets** in the desktop app. This option requires your main 5-hour or weekly allowance to have 10% or less remaining.

# What happens when you use a banked reset?

A full banked reset restores the main Codex allowances on your current plan:

* **Go:** The monthly allowance.
* **Plus and Business Standard:** The 5-hour and weekly allowances.
* **Pro 100, Pro 200, and Pro 500:** The weekly allowance.

When you use the reset, each covered allowance below 100% is restored to 100%. An allowance already at 100% is not restarted by the banked reset.

On plans with both limits, the same usage counts against the 5-hour and weekly allowances, but those periods can end at different times. For example, your weekly period could end at noon while your current 5-hour period continues until 3 p.m. Before you use Codex again, you could have 100% weekly remaining and 10% 5-hour remaining. A banked reset used then restores the 5-hour allowance without restarting the weekly period.

The banked reset is counted as used only when it restores at least one covered allowance. If no covered allowance qualifies, the reset remains available.

A “full” reset applies to your main Codex allowance. Separate model or feature allowances, such as ChatGPT’s image-generation, file-upload, and regular Chat Voice limits, remain unchanged.

# Why your reset time can change

Banked, global, and paid resets can change the next refresh time for the allowances they affect without changing your subscription billing date. When a reset restarts a usage period, the new schedule replaces the old one. For example, if a weekly period that was due to end on Friday restarts on Tuesday, its next refresh is the following Tuesday; the original Friday refresh no longer applies.

Check **Usage** for your next refresh time rather than calculating it from when you selected a reset, completed a purchase, or saw an announcement. Before a new usage period starts, the displayed time may be an estimate and can change. A change in that date alone does not mean another banked reset was used.

# Global resets after a banked reset

If a global reset covers the same allowance you restored with a banked reset, it brings that allowance back to 100% and can change its next refresh time again. For example, if you use a banked reset at 10:00 a.m. and then use 5% of the refreshed allowance, a global reset at 10:30 a.m. takes it from 95% to 100%. The two resets do not add together to give you 200% of your allowance.

The banked reset you used is not returned. Any unused banked resets stay in your balance with their original expiration and offer terms, because a global reset does not consume them.

# View your banked-reset history

In the desktop app, open **Settings > Usage & billing** and select **History** under **Usage limit resets** to see banked-reset activity from the past 30 days. The mobile app does not currently have this history or reset controls.

* **Reset received** means a banked reset was added for later use; it does not mean your usage was refreshed.
* **Reset used** means a banked reset was redeemed.

**Available** shows the banked resets you can still use and their expiration dates. A reset listed as received in **History** may already have been used or expired, so that entry does not tell you whether it is still available.

Paid and global resets do not appear in this history, so a missing entry does not mean a paid reset failed or that you missed a global reset. A global reset can change your allowance and next refresh time without creating a history entry.

History also does not show why you qualified, who or what triggered a reset’s use, or how it changed your allowance and reset dates. A changed allowance or date alone cannot identify which global reset, if any, applied to your account.

# Eligibility and expiration for free resets

OpenAI selects the recipients, covered limits, delivery timing, and expiration for each promotional offer. Check the original announcement for eligible plans and accounts, regional restrictions, qualifying deadlines, and updates. Having the same plan as someone who received a reset, or receiving one in an earlier offer, does not guarantee inclusion.

An offer may include an automatic reset, a banked reset, or both. If it includes only an automatic reset, you will not receive a banked reset to save for later. For a banked offer, the delivery window tells you when the reset is expected to be added, and eligible accounts may receive it at different times within that window.

Use a banked reset before the expiration date and time shown in your account or offer, checking the time zone where provided. This is the deadline to redeem it; after use, the refreshed allowance follows its own usage period and next refresh time.

Banked resets are not cash, API credits, or transferable credit balances. For referral-specific terms, see: [ChatGPT Desktop Referral Promotions](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001271).

# Check your reset and usage

Usage can take a short time to update after a reset. If the allowance does not look right, refresh or reopen **Usage settings** and confirm that you are viewing the correct account, workspace, and usage limit. Do not use another banked reset or buy another reset just to test whether the first worked.

If a banked reset was used unexpectedly, review its entry in **History** and your recent conversation with Codex for a request or confirmation to use it. To use resets only through the manual controls in future, turn off **Allow your assistant to use resets** in the desktop app.

For a paid reset, your receipt is in **Settings > Usage & billing** on desktop or **Settings > Billing** on the web. It confirms the purchase, but does not by itself confirm that the reset was applied.

# Limits on free promotional resets

Support does not review individual promotional eligibility, investigate whether a free reset should have been granted or applied, change an offer’s terms, or add an account to an offer.

Support does not provide manual or courtesy promotional resets, extend expiration dates, or replace free resets that were not received, expired, were used accidentally, or were followed by another reset. We do not provide credits, refunds, or other compensation for these free benefits.

This policy applies to free promotional resets. Paid reset purchases and other billed services are handled separately; see: [Paid weekly Work and Codex rate limit resets](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001507) for purchase and billing guidance.
