# February 24th, 2026

Build: 1.2026.49

## **Agent Mode**

* We've reduced 'laziness' of ChatGPT when in Agent Mode. You'll notice in Agent Mode that ChatGPT is now more persistent on repetitive and tedious tasks (e.g. asking the agent to go through hundreds of emails and extracting action items).

* Now, when you do "Command+F" to find text on a page, if there are no exact matches, you can find similar matches.

## **Bug fixes**

## **Bug fixes**

ChatGPT Atlas is a new web browser with ChatGPT built in. Available on macOS for Free, Plus, Pro, Go users globally and in beta for Business users. With ChatGPT built into your browser, you can get help anywhere on the web. To get started, visit [chatgpt.com/atlas](http://chatgpt.com/atlas) to download. You can bring your saved passwords, bookmarks, and browsing history from another browser.

Here are some of our key features available in Atlas.

**New tab page**

AskChatGPT a question or enter a URL to see faster, more useful results in one place.

**Smarter searches**

To explore more specific types of results beyond the chat, select from tabs for search links, images, videos, and news (where available).

**Ask ChatGPT sidebar**

Open ChatGPT sidebar on any page to summarize, analyze, or handle tasks directly in the same window.

**In line writing help**

Pull up ChatGPT in any form field to write or edit without switching tabs. Highlight text inside the form field or document and click the ChatGPT logo to get started.

**Browser memories**

If you turn on browser memories, ChatGPT will remember key details from your web browsing to improve chat responses and offer smarter suggestions—like retrieving a webpage you read a while ago. Browser memories are private to your account and under your control. You can view them all in settings, archive ones that are no longer relevant, and clear your browsing history to delete them. Even when browser memories are on, you can decide which sites ChatGPT can’t see using the toggle in the address bar. When visibility is off, ChatGPT can’t view the page content, and no memories are created from it.

**Home page suggestions**

ChatGPT remembers what you’ve explored and suggests what to do next, whether that’s returning to past pages, digging deeper into a topic, surfacing related ideas, or automating routine tasks.

**Agent Mode (Preview)**

Plus, Pro, and Business users can now enable agent mode in Atlas to let ChatGPT do work on your behalf and always under your control. In agent mode, ChatGPT can complete end to end tasks for you like researching a meal plan, making a list of ingredients, and adding the groceries to a shopping cart ready for delivery. You’re always in control: ChatGPT is trained to ask before taking many important actions, and you can pause, interrupt, or take over the browser at any time.

Agent Mode runs also operates under boundaries:

System access: Cannot run code in the browser, download files, or install extensions.

Data access: Cannot access other apps on your computer or your file system, read or write ChatGPT memories, access saved passwords, or use autofill data.

Browsing activity: Pages ChatGPT visits in agent mode are not added to your browsing history.

You can also choose to run agent in logged out mode, and ChatGPT won’t use any pre-existing cookies and won’t be logged into any of your online accounts without your specific approval.

These efforts don’t eliminate every risk; users should still use caution and monitor ChatGPT activities when using agent mode.

**Privacy and data controls**

We’ve made it easy to control and adjust your settings in Atlas. You can clear history for a page or your full history altogether. You can also open an incognito window where you’re signed out of ChatGPT and chats and memory won’t be saved to your account.

By default, we don’t use the content you browse to train our models. If you choose to opt-in this content, you can enable “include web browsing” in your Atlas data controls settings. If you've enabled training for chats in your ChatGPT account, training will also be enabled for chats in Atlas. This includes website content you've attached when using the Ask ChatGPT sidebar and details from browser memories that inform your chats.

**Parental controls**

If a parent has set up parental controls for ChatGPT, these settings will carry over to conversations with ChatGPT in Atlas. We’re also introducing new parental controls in Atlas, including the option for parents to turn off browser memories and agent mode.
