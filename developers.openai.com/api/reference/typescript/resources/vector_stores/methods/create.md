# Create vector store

client.vectorStores.create(VectorStoreCreateParams { chunking\_strategy, description, expires\_after, 3 more } body, RequestOptionsoptions?): [VectorStore](/api/reference/typescript/resources/vector_stores#(resource)%20vector_stores%20%3E%20(model)%20vector_store%20%3E%20(schema)) { id, created\_at, file\_counts, 8 more }

POST/vector\_stores

Create a vector store.

##### ParametersExpand Collapse

body: VectorStoreCreateParams { chunking\_strategy, description, expires\_after, 3 more }

chunking\_strategy?: [FileChunkingStrategyParam](/api/reference/typescript/resources/vector_stores#(resource)%20vector_stores%20%3E%20(model)%20file_chunking_strategy_param%20%3E%20(schema))

The chunking strategy used to chunk the file(s). If not set, will use the `auto` strategy. Only applicable if `file_ids` is non-empty.

One of the following:

AutoFileChunkingStrategyParam { type }

The default strategy. This strategy currently uses a `max_chunk_size_tokens` of `800` and `chunk_overlap_tokens` of `400`.

type: "auto"

Always `auto`.

StaticFileChunkingStrategyObjectParam { static, type }

Customize your own chunking strategy by setting chunk size and chunk overlap.

static: [StaticFileChunkingStrategy](/api/reference/typescript/resources/vector_stores#(resource)%20vector_stores%20%3E%20(model)%20static_file_chunking_strategy%20%3E%20(schema)) { chunk\_overlap\_tokens, max\_chunk\_size\_tokens }

chunk\_overlap\_tokens: number

The number of tokens that overlap between chunks. The default value is `400`.

Note that the overlap must not exceed half of `max_chunk_size_tokens`.

max\_chunk\_size\_tokens: number

The maximum number of tokens in each chunk. The default value is `800`. The minimum value is `100` and the maximum value is `4096`.

minimum100

maximum4096

type: "static"

Always `static`.

description?: string

A description for the vector store. Can be used to describe the vector store’s purpose.

expires\_after?: [ExpiresAfter](/api/reference/typescript/resources/vector_stores/methods/create#(resource)%20vector_stores%20%3E%20(method)%20create%20%3E%20(params)%20default%20%3E%20(param)%20expires_after%20%3E%20(schema))

The expiration policy for a vector store.

anchor: "last\_active\_at"

Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `last_active_at`.

days: number

The number of days after the anchor time that the vector store will expire.

minimum1

maximum365

file\_ids?: Array<string>

A list of [File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files) IDs that the vector store should use. Useful for tools like `file_search` that can access files.

metadata?: [Metadata](/api/reference/typescript/resources/$shared#(resource)%20%24shared%20%3E%20(model)%20metadata%20%3E%20(schema)) | null

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be
useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
with a maximum length of 512 characters.

name?: string

The name of the vector store.

##### ReturnsExpand Collapse

VectorStore { id, created\_at, file\_counts, 8 more }

A vector store is a collection of processed files can be used by the `file_search` tool.

id: string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

created\_at: number

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was created.

formatunixtime

file\_counts: FileCounts { cancelled, completed, failed, 2 more }

cancelled: number

The number of files that were cancelled.

completed: number

The number of files that have been successfully processed.

failed: number

The number of files that have failed to process.

in\_progress: number

The number of files that are currently being processed.

total: number

The total number of files.

last\_active\_at: number | null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was last active.

formatunixtime

metadata: [Metadata](/api/reference/typescript/resources/$shared#(resource)%20%24shared%20%3E%20(model)%20metadata%20%3E%20(schema)) | null

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be
useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
with a maximum length of 512 characters.

name: string

The name of the vector store.

object: "vector\_store"

The object type, which is always `vector_store`.

status: "expired" | "in\_progress" | "completed"

The status of the vector store, which can be either `expired`, `in_progress`, or `completed`. A status of `completed` indicates that the vector store is ready for use.

One of the following:

"expired"

"in\_progress"

"completed"

usage\_bytes: number

The total number of bytes used by the files in the vector store.

expires\_after?: ExpiresAfter { anchor, days }

The expiration policy for a vector store.

anchor: "last\_active\_at"

Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `last_active_at`.

days: number

The number of days after the anchor time that the vector store will expire.

minimum1

maximum365

expires\_at?: number | null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store will expire.
