GET/organization/certificates

##### ParametersExpand Collapse

query: CertificateListParams { after, limit, order }

after?: string

A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj\_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj\_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

limit?: number

A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.

order?: "asc" | "desc"

Sort order by the `created_at` timestamp of the objects. `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.

One of the following:

"asc"

"desc"
