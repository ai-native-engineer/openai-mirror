# Retrieve run step

Deprecated: The Assistants API is deprecated in favor of the Responses API

client.beta.threads.runs.steps.retrieve(stringstepID, StepRetrieveParams { thread\_id, run\_id, include } params, RequestOptionsoptions?): [RunStep](/api/reference/typescript/resources/beta#(resource)%20beta.threads.runs.steps%20%3E%20(model)%20run_step%20%3E%20(schema)) { id, assistant\_id, cancelled\_at, 13 more }

GET/threads/{thread\_id}/runs/{run\_id}/steps/{step\_id}

Retrieves a run step.

##### ParametersExpand Collapse

stepID: string

params: StepRetrieveParams { thread\_id, run\_id, include }

thread\_id: string

Path param: The ID of the thread to which the run and run step belongs.

run\_id: string

Path param: The ID of the run to which the run step belongs.

include?: Array<[RunStepInclude](/api/reference/typescript/resources/beta#(resource)%20beta.threads.runs.steps%20%3E%20(model)%20run_step_include%20%3E%20(schema)) {  } >

Query param: A list of additional fields to include in the response. Currently the only supported value is `step_details.tool_calls[*].file_search.results[*].content` to fetch the file search result content.

See the [file search tool documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#customizing-file-search-settings) for more information.

format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
with a maximum length of 512 characters.

object: "thread.run.step"

The object type, which is always `thread.run.step`.
