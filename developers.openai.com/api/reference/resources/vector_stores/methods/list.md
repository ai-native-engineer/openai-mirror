# List vector stores

GET/vector\_stores

Returns a list of vector stores.

##### Query ParametersExpand Collapse

after: optional string

A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj\_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj\_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.

before: optional string

A cursor for use in pagination. `before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj\_foo, your subsequent call can include before=obj\_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list.

limit: optional number

A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20.

order: optional "asc" or "desc"

Sort order by the `created_at` timestamp of the objects. `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.

One of the following:

"asc"

"desc"

data: array of [VectorStore](/api/reference/resources/vector_stores#(resource)%20vector_stores%20%3E%20(model)%20vector_store%20%3E%20(schema)) { id, created\_at, file\_counts, 8 more }

id: string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

created\_at: number

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was created.

formatunixtime

file\_counts: object { cancelled, completed, failed, 2 more }

cancelled: number

The number of files that were cancelled.

completed: number

The number of files that have been successfully processed.

failed: number

The number of files that have failed to process.

in\_progress: number

The number of files that are currently being processed.

total: number

The total number of files.

last\_active\_at: number

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store was last active.

formatunixtime

metadata: [Metadata](/api/reference/resources/$shared#(resource)%20%24shared%20%3E%20(model)%20metadata%20%3E%20(schema))

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be
useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured
format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings
with a maximum length of 512 characters.

name: string

The name of the vector store.

object: "vector\_store"

The object type, which is always `vector_store`.

status: "expired" or "in\_progress" or "completed"

The status of the vector store, which can be either `expired`, `in_progress`, or `completed`. A status of `completed` indicates that the vector store is ready for use.

One of the following:

"expired"

"in\_progress"

"completed"

usage\_bytes: number

The total number of bytes used by the files in the vector store.

expires\_after: optional object { anchor, days }

The expiration policy for a vector store.

anchor: "last\_active\_at"

Anchor timestamp after which the expiration policy applies. Supported anchors: `last_active_at`.

days: number

The number of days after the anchor time that the vector store will expire.

minimum1

maximum365

expires\_at: optional number

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store will expire.

first\_id: string

has\_more: boolean

last\_id: string
