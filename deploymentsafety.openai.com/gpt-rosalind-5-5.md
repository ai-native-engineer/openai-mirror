GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is a new model in the GPT-Rosalind series, our
frontier reasoning model built to support research across biology, drug
discovery, and translational medicine. We are deploying it in research
preview to trusted organizations, providing access limited to qualified
scientists, research institutes and government partners who are working
on beneficial uses and who have a strong security and governance
posture.

GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is incrementally trained from GPT-5.5, our flagship
reasoning model. Outside the biological domain, its capabilities are
comparable to GPT-5.5 and it receives the same model-level safety
training. We therefore have not provided evaluation results from those
capabilities in this system card.

We worked with industry experts to design and evaluate
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 on a series of benchmarks across medicinal chemistry,
quantitative biology, wet lab protocol assistance, and applied life
sciences research. Beneficial biological capabilities, as expected,
exceed those of the regular GPT-5.5 model, often while expending fewer
tokens.

Under our Preparedness Framework, the Preparedness evaluations in the
Biological and Chemical domain met our threshold for High capability
while falling below the threshold for Critical. Cybersecurity
capabilities were found to be at or below the level of GPT-5.5. Because
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 was trained on additional biology data unrelated to AI
self-improvement, we rely on GPT-5.5’s existing Preparedness assessment
for AI Self-Improvement, where GPT-5.5 did not meet the threshold for
High capability. Our Safety Advisory Group approved the safeguards plan
for this release, finding that it sufficiently mitigates the associated
risks of severe harm.

Below we describe the incremental biological capability findings for
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 compared with GPT-5.5, and describe the differences in
safeguard approach for this deployment compared with the primary GPT-5.5
model.

GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is incrementally trained from GPT-5.5 with training
data related to beneficial life sciences capability. Unlike GPT-5.5, it
is trained not to refuse sophisticated biology queries, and leverages a
trusted access and responsible deployment structure as the primary
safeguard.

The Beneficial Capability Evaluations below measure how well
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 performs on the intended research-support tasks it was
designed to improve. Preparedness evaluations, in the following section,
measure related but distinct risk-relevant capabilities under OpenAI’s
Preparedness Framework, where results are interpreted against
severe-harm thresholds to inform safeguards and deployment decisions,
rather than as the primary measure of product benefit.

A higher score on an evaluation indicates higher capability in that
domain.

To evaluate GPT-Rosalind-5.5 on medicinal chemistry, a field focused
on turning molecules into useful drugs, we designed a multimodal
evaluation designed to measure realistic medicinal chemistry workflows,
evaluating multimodal chemical structure understanding;
structure-activity relationship (SAR); prediction of drug potency,
toxicity, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME);
multiparameter lead-optimization decision-making, and
retrosynthesis.

### Table 1

To evaluate GPT-Rosalind-5.5 on genomics understanding and
quantitative biology, we designed an agentic evaluation on long horizon,
end-to-end genomics analysis tasks. This evaluation assesses agentic
performance on long-horizon quantitative tasks: based on realistic
scientific data, can an agent plan valid analysis, QC, modeling, and
corrections to arrive at decision-relative answers? Genebench spans a
variety of domains, including functional genomics, spatial
transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and applied genetics.

### Table 2

In order to measure and continuously improve the real world impact of
GPT-Rosalind, we designed **LifeSciBench**, an externally
expert-judged benchmark on foundational aspects of life sciences
research. Unlike existing benchmarks that evaluate a single component of
model performance or biological domain in isolation, LifeSciBench takes
an end-to-end view of scientifically-valuable tasks from practicing life
sciences researchers. We use this benchmark to align progress with the
needs and realities of beneficial life sciences research.

### Table 3

To test GPT-Rosalind-5.5’s ability to help scientists conducting lab
work in the real world, we designed an evaluation to measure model’s
ability to link perturbations to experimental outcomes in real wet lab
protocols used by scientists, for the purposes ranging from
troubleshooting to optimization. The data used by Labwork Bench is
proprietary and thus uncontaminated. GPT-Rosalind-5.5 scores 63.2% vs.
GPT-5.5 at 55.8%, while using fewer tokens.

### Table 4

frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm. Under our
framework, we work to track and mitigate the risk of severe harm,
for highly capable models.

As we did for GPT-5.5, we are treating this launch as High capability
in the Biological and Chemical domain. Below, we describe the
evaluations we used to reach this conclusion. A higher score on an
evaluation indicates higher capability in that domain. As expected,
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 scores meet or exceed GPT-5.5’s capability of all the
following evaluations but one (Multi-Select Virology Troubleshooting).
We also show values for GPT-5.5 Pro, which is run with roughly an order
of magnitude higher inference budget and thus is expected to exceed
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 performance in some areas. In particular,
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 was not specifically trained on virology or biothreat
creation, and for these evaluations it expectedly underperforms GPT-5.5
Pro.

### Table 5: Overview of Biological and Chemical evaluations

Table 5. Overview of Biological and Chemical evaluations

| Biorisk knowledge | Biorisk-relevant knowledge (closed-ended) | Can models answer closed-ended questions probing biosecurity-relevant biology and laboratory knowledge? |
| Multi-select virology troubleshooting | Wet lab troubleshooting (multi-select) | Can models identify likely causes and fixes for virology protocol failures when multiple correct options may apply? |
| Hard-negative protein binding prediction | Protein design | Can the model distinguish “gain of function” (binder) protein variants from non-functional (non-binder) proteins, given high quality 3D structure predictions and confidence scores from biological design tools? |
| DNA sequence design for transcription factor binding | DNA design | Can the model design DNA sequences to maximally bind known transcription factors, with better performance than freely available gradient-based methods? |

### Table 6: To evaluate models’ ability to troubleshoot commonly published lab protocols, we modify 108 multiple choice questions from FutureHouse’s ProtocolQA dataset laurent2024labbenchmeasuringcapabilitieslanguage to be open-ended short answer questions, which makes the evaluation harder and more realistic than the multiple-choice version. The questions introduce egregious errors in common published protocols, describe the wet lab result of carrying out this protocol, and ask for how to fix the procedure.

troubleshooting questions.

### Table 7: Compared to ProtocolQA Open-Ended, which focuses on well-known published procedures, TroubleshootingBench is designed to test model performance on non-public, experience-grounded protocols and errors that rely on tacit procedural knowledge

### Table 8: This set is uncontaminated; it was created fully in-house with our partners at Gryphon Scientific and has not been published.

### Table 9: To evaluate models’ ability to troubleshoot wet lab experiments in a multimodal setting, we evaluate models on a set of fully held-out virology troubleshooting questions from https://securebio.org/SecureBio, in a multi-select format.

Offensive capabilities in an AI system likely require expert
sequence-to-function knowledge, which can be measured by its ability to
distinguish gain-of-function sequences using information beyond that
provided by sophisticated biological design tools. We probe this
capability using a proprietary, non-contaminated dataset of
protein-binding experimental results spanning 43 unique protein targets
and 492 hotspots. In this task, gain of function is operationalized as
binding capability: the model must distinguish functional (binding)
proteins from non-functional (non-binding) proteins.

We structure each problem to minimize the effectiveness of trivial
data-science heuristics and thereby measure uplift attributable to
expert biochemical knowledge. In each task, the model is given five
candidate binders designed against the same hotspot on a target protein,
with pairwise sequence similarity of at least 0.85. All candidates in
this setting had AlphaFold 2 interface predicted TM (ipTM) scores of at
least 0.8, indicating high-confidence, high-quality binding predictions.
This setup removes the trivial strategy of selecting candidates solely
on the basis of a high ipTM score.

The model was additionally given 3D structures of the predicted
protein-protein binding complexes as PDB files, along with access to a
computer and a browser to fully elicit its tool-use and reasoning
capabilities in a long-horizon, agentic setting. The model is not told
how many true binders exist among the set of 5, while the true number
was held at 1 to properly reflect the rarity of true binders and to
avoid uplift from simple heuristics such as clustering.

### Table 10: Biological experiments are costly and iterative. Because errors compound across steps, a single low-success-rate step can substantially constrain a project’s overall probability of success. We hypothesize that a qualitative capability shift is most likely to emerge when stepwise success rates exceed a relatively high threshold. Accordingly, we propose 50% correctness as the threshold for biorisk concern.

We evaluate the model’s ability to design DNA sequences with high
binding affinity for well-known transcription factors (TFs),
benchmarking it against widely-available gradient-based design methods.
Designing sequences with high binding affinity to TFs could allow
modulation of gene expression through gene-editing approaches. We
evaluate the model on 11 TFs drawn from Nucleobench, creating 50 prompts
per TF. Each prompt contains a starting sequence of 3000 basepairs
chosen at random from an {A,C,G,T} vocabulary. Generated sequences are
scored using high-performance oracles from the TF-specific models in the
BPNet family, with Basenji2 models as secondary oracles when available
for the TF of interest.

We benchmark model performance against a freely available and simple
gradient-based approach, Ledidi, which was found to be competitive in
Nucleobench for many sequence-design tasks. We set a threshold of 80%
win rate over Ledidi for significant DNA design capabilities. We find
that GPT-Rosalind-5.5 performs significantly below this baseline.

### Table 11

Compared to GPT-5.5, GPT-Rosalind-5.5 features additional deployment
controls for its use in advanced life sciences research.
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is a limited, controlled deployment; access is limited
to approved customers through our trusted-access deployment structure
where organizations must demonstrate they are conducting legitimate
scientific research with public benefit, have strong governance and
safety oversight, and controlled access with enterprise-grade
security.

Our safeguard approach for GPT-Rosalind-5.5 has four main components:
trusted access controls for verified higher-capability life sciences
use, model-level boundaries against harmful biological and cyber
assistance, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms designed to detect
abuse, and additional contractual requirements to enhance security.
Unlike our safeguards posture for our more broadly distributed flagship
models, in this case we are not deploying automated monitors for
real-time blocking of potentially unsafe generations.

GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is available only to approved customers. Before
granting access, OpenAI reviews whether the applicant has a legitimate
life sciences or related mission, a credible use case, appropriate
research and operational governance, and the ability to safely control
access to the model.

For non-government applicants, OpenAI also employs business
verification and compliance-screening checks. These checks help confirm
applicant authenticity and reduce the risk of access by fraudulent,
insufficiently attributable, or otherwise unsuitable actors. These
checks supplement OpenAI’s broader review of the applicant’s proposed
use case, safety posture, and access scope.

For government applicants, OpenAI has also introduced a
trusted-access pathway for select government entities working on
approved biosecurity, biosafety, public-health preparedness, and
biodefense use cases, as described in a recent [blog
post](https://openai.com/index/strengthening-societal-resilience-with-rosalind-biodefense/). This pathway is intended to help responsible government users
apply advanced life sciences capabilities to preparedness-oriented work,
such as improving public-health readiness, strengthening biosafety and
biosecurity, supporting biological threat assessment, and accelerating
beneficial medical countermeasure or response-related research.

Approved customers must limit GPT-Rosalind-5.5 access to authorized
users with a legitimate need and apply least-privilege access controls,
appropriate onboarding, and insider risk controls to their users.

GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is designed to be more useful for legitimate
advanced biological research than generally available ChatGPT models.
This includes support for advanced life sciences workflows such as
literature and knowledge retrieval, data parsing and analysis,
computational biology, and use of specialized biology tools and
databases.

Like GPT-5.5, GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is trained to refuse malicious
requests that would meaningfully enable biological weaponization.

Because some advanced biological capabilities are dual-use,
GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is not broadly available. Access is gated through the
trusted access review process described above.

GPT-Rosalind-5.5 inherits the model-level cyber safeguards of the
GPT-5.5 base model.

The model continues to refuse requests that clearly enable
unauthorized, destructive, or harmful cyber activity, including areas
such as malware deployment, credential theft, exfiltration, or other
malicious activity.

OpenAI will monitor for cyber misuse and investigate activity that
appears misaligned with the customer’s approved life sciences use case.
Confirmed malicious cyber activity may result in enforcement under
OpenAI’s Usage Policies, including potential account banning or
revocation of GPT-Rosalind-5.5 access.

OpenAI maintains monitoring, review, and enforcement processes to
help identify potential misuse after access is granted. These processes
are designed to detect activity that may indicate biological
weaponization, malicious cyber activity, unauthorized access, or use
that is materially inconsistent with the customer’s approved
purpose.

OpenAI uses a variety of signals to assess potential misuse,
including automated safety classifiers, account- or organization-level
indicators, customer-provided information, and, where available,
specialist review of potentially high-risk activity. The specific review
process depends on the deployment configuration and the information
available to OpenAI.

Because advanced life sciences work is inherently dual-use, some
legitimate research activity may require contextual review. Our process
considers both the risk of the activity and the apparent purpose of the
use, including whether it remains aligned with the customer’s approved
life sciences, public-health, biosafety, biosecurity, or biodefense use
case. Activity that appears to cross into biological weaponization,
malicious cyber activity, unauthorized access, or other prohibited
harmful use may be flagged for review and action. OpenAI also seeks to
monitor for unresolved customer security concerns, failure to maintain
required access controls, or material changes in approved use case,
deployment pathway, or user population.

OpenAI reserves the option to apply additional monitoring, request
information from the customer, narrow or restrict access, require
remediation of security or governance issues, or revoke GPT-Rosalind-5.5
access.

Approved GPT-Rosalind-5.5 customers must maintain security controls
appropriate for access to a higher-capability life sciences model. These
include strong identity and access management, administrator controls,
role-based access controls, and processes to remove access when a user
no longer has a legitimate need.

These controls are intended to help ensure that GPT-Rosalind-5.5 is
used only by approved users, for approved purposes, within accountable
organizations.

As with other OpenAI deployments, we expect to continue learning from
real-world use. We will monitor safety signals, customer experience, and
emerging misuse patterns, and may update GPT-Rosalind-5.5 safeguards as
the deployment evolves.
